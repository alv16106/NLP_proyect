Down my lover, down my child, away my Father, away ella
Fortune never shined inside the light you pour to me
Down my lover, down my child, away my former beings

Fourteen Seventeen times I've been denied

(I was totally wrong
The morning arrives with new hope and optimism
After lengths of time that rapidly fade. 
Eventually, as always, the thoughts of better times give way to fear and inevitable conflict
Here we found ourselves, again)
