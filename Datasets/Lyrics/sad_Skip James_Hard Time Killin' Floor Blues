Hard time's is here
An ev'rywhere you go
Times are harder
Than th'ever been befo'

You know that people
They are driftin' from do' to do'
But they can't find no heaven
I don't care where they go

People, if I ever can get up
Off a-this old hard killin' flo'
Lord, I'll never get down
This low no mo'

Well, you hear me singin'

This old lonesome song
People, you know these hard times
Can't last us so long

Hm, hm-hm, oh Lord

You know, you'll say you had money
You better be sho'
But these hard times gon' kill you
Just drive a lonely soul
