In this secret way he knew you first.

...And from those lips a seed.

Your mouth dropped open, darkness fell out.

Kept close in skin, kept close in blood, and in he was.

...And from those lips a seed.

This is the gift that he received.
Twisted roots kept warm.

Rape she was and ready for the death.
