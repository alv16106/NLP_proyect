Well I'm sure it never used to be
So hard, this hard
Used to get those kicks for free
But now I'm toeing the line

Oh, this ain't no way to be
Stuck between my shadow and me
Put it where the sun don't shine
Although I'll tell you that I'm doing fine, oh

I'm so tired of repeatin' myself
Beatin' myself up
Gonna take a trip and multiply
Wanna 'least go under with a smile

I'm so tired of repeatin' myself
Beatin' myself up
Gonna take a trip and multiply
Wanna 'least go under with a smile

Sure never used to be
In trouble, so much trouble
Love is just a shackle I see
Goin' out of my mind

This ain't no way to be
Stuck between my shadow and me
The sun's going down, it's getting dark in here
Still folks see, I got nothing to fear

I'm so tired of repeatin' myself
Beatin' myself up
Gonna take a trip and multiply
Wanna 'least go under with a smile

I'm so tired of repeatin' myself
Beatin' myself up
Gonna take a trip and multiply
Wanna 'least go under with a smile

People on the street
There are many, many
People on the moon
There ain't any, any
Runnin' down the same old hole
Takin' a dive 'cause I got no control

I'm so tired, I'm so tired, I'm so tired
So tired, so tired, so tired, so tired
So tired, so tired, so tired, so tired
So tired, so tired

I'm so tired of repeatin' myself
Beatin' myself up
Wanna take a trip and multiply
Wanna 'least go under with a smile

I'm so tired of repeatin' myself
Beatin' myself up
Take a trip and multiply
Wanna 'least go under with a smile

I'm so, so tired, so tired
