Plowin' these fields in the hot summer sun,
Over by the gate, Lordy, here she comes
With a basket full of chicken and a big cold jug of sweet tea.

I make a little room and she climbs on up
Open up her throttle and stir a little dust
Just look at her face, she ain't foolin' me

She thinks my tractor's sexy
It really turns her on
She's always starin' at me
While I'm chuggin' along
She likes the way it's pullin' while we're tillin' up the land
She's even kinda crazy 'bout my farmer's tan
She's the only one who really understands what gets me
She thinks my tractor's sexy

We'll ride back and forth till we run outta light
Take it to the barn, put it up for the night
Climb up in the loft, sit and talk with the radio on
She says she got a dream and I ask what it is
She wants a little farm and a yard full of kids
And one more teeny weeny ride before I take her home

She thinks my tractor's sexy
It really turns her on
She's always starin' at me
While I'm chuggin' along
She likes the way it pullin' while we're tillin' up the land
She's even kinda crazy 'bout my farmers tan
She's the only one who really understands what gets me
She thinks my tractors sexy

Well she ain't into cars or pick up trucks
But if it runs likes a Deere, man, her eyes light up

She thinks my tractor
She thinks my tractor's sexy
It really turns her on
She's always starin' at me
While I'm chuggin' along
She likes the way it's pullin' while we're tillin' up the land
She's even kinda crazy 'bout my farmer's tan
She's the only one who really understands what gets me
She thinks my tractor's sexy
She thinks my tractor's sexy
She thinks my tractor's sexy
