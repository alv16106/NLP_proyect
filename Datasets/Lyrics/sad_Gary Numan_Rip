I'll get down on my knees
I'll do anything I can
I'll even walk upon water
I'll burn the soul of man

I'm so sick with need
I'm so sick with pain
I'll lay before the cross and pray
I'll bleed like holy rain

(Here's something for you)

Hey Hey HEY
I've got nothing to do
Hey Hey HEY
I've done nothing to you
Hey Hey HEY
I've got nothing to do
Hey Hey HEY
I've done nothing to you

I'll rip the skin from God's face
I'll say I'm searching for the truth
I stole the light from Heaven's gates
If it, if it can guide me to you

I'll give life to obsession
I'll give life to disease
I'll give you one last sin or cure
And then I'll do as I please

Hey Hey HEY
I've got something for you
Hey Hey HEY
I've got something for you

I've got something for you

I've got something for you
