Up in the mornin', out on the job
Work like the devil for my pay
But that lucky old sun got nothin' to do
But roll around heaven all day

Fuss with my woman, toil for my kids
Sweat till I'm wrinkled and gray
While that lucky old sun has nothing to do
But roll around heaven all day

Good Lord up above, can't you know I'm pining
Tears all in my eyes
Send down that cloud with a silver lining
Lift me to paradise

Show me that river, take me across
And wash all my troubles away
Like that lucky old sun, give me nothing to do
But roll around heaven all day

(Good Lord up above, can't you know I'm pining)
(Tears all in my eyes)
(Send down that cloud with a silver lining)
(Lift me to paradise)

Show me that river, take me across
And wash all my troubles away
Like that lucky old sun, give me nothing to do
But roll around (heaven, heaven)
Oh, roll around (heaven, heaven)
Roll around heaven all day
(Let me roll around heaven all day)
