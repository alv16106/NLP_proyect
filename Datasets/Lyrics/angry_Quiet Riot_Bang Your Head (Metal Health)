Yeah!

Well, I'm an axe grinder
Piledriver
Mama says that I never, never mind her
Got no brains
I'm insane
The teacher says that I'm one big pain

I'm like a laser
Six-string razor
I got a mouth like an alligator
I want it louder
More power
I'm gonna rock it 'til it strikes the hour

Bang your head
Metal health will drive you mad
Bang your head
Metal health will drive you mad, all right

Well, I'm frustrated
Outdated
I really want to be overrated
I'm a finder
And I'm a keeper
I'm not a loser and I ain't no weeper

I got the boys
To make the noise
Won't ever let up, hope it annoys you
Join the pack
Fill the crack
Well, now you're here, there's no way back

Bang your head
Metal health will drive you mad
Bang your head
Metal health will drive you mad

Metal health will cure your crazy
Metal health will cure your mad
Metal health is what we all need
It's what you oughta have 

Yeah!

Bang your head
Wake the dead
We're all metal mad
It's all you have
So bang your head
And raise the dead, oh yeah
Metal health
It drives you mad, mad, mad, mad

Bang your head
Metal health will drive you mad
Bang your head
Metal health will drive you mad

(Oh, get your straitjackets on tonight, oh
The bad boys are gonna set you right
Oh rock on, rock on, rock ya)

Bang your head
Metal health will drive you mad
Bang your head
