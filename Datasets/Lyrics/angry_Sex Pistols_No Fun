Right here we go now
A sociology lecture
With a bit of psychology
A bit of neurology
A bit of fuck-all-ology
No fun

Right no fun
My babe no fun
No fun
My babe no fun
Fun to be alone
Alone and by myself
Fun to be alone
In love with nobody else

No fun
My babe no fun
No fun
My babe no fun
Fun to be alone
Walking by myself
Fun to be alone
In love with no friends of mine

Maybe going out
Or maybe stay at home
Maybe call somebody on the telephone
So c'mon my baby c'mon
So c'mon
I'm alone
Having no fun by myself
This is no fun with nobody else
I'm all alone
By myself
I'll be alone
Nobody else
It's no fun
It;sno fun all alone
All alone no fun
All alone
No fun
I'm alone
I'm alive
I'm alone
And I'm waiting to have my fun
I'm waiting ain't got no one
I'm all alone
This is no fun

All alone
I'm alive
No fun
I'm alive
I'm alone

No fun

No fun
My babe no fun
Fun to be alone
Walking by myself
Fun to be alone
In love with nobody else

Maybe go out
Maybe stay at home
Maybe call somebody on the telephone
So c'mon
I'm all alone
So c'mon
Oh come and play
I'm alone I'm alone
With nobody else

All by myself
And I want some fun with somebody else
My baby's alone on the lavatory
My babay won't come play with me
I'm alone
All alone
I'm looking at the telephone
I'm alone
All alone
I got nobody else
I want my fun
I'm gonna make my own fun
All alone
I'm alive
It's no fun
I'm alive
No fun
It's no fun
No fun

It's no fun
No fun

It's not funny
I'm by myself
I'm alive
