Dear God I'm writing this letter to you.
'Cause I don't have a clue, can you help me?
I'm sittin' here, simply trying to figure out.
What my life's all about, can you tell me?

I never wanted to be, the person you see
Can you tell me who I am?
I always wanted to die, but you kept me here, alive.
Can you tell me who I am?

I lie awake conducting this symphony, that you have gifted to me
But I can't ever sleep.
Don't be mad, but I get weak inside, and I start to fall apart
'Cause I feel nothing.

I never wanted to be, some kind of comic relief.
Please show me who I am.
I've been tortured and scorned, since the day that I was born.
But I don't know who I am.

And I thank you man for everything.
Sorry I'm so frightened about all of it,
But I wish I could give you more.

But all the lights are shining down on me,
And I feel intimidated by it all.

I never wanted to be
The person you see, but thank you.

Oh god please tell me now
Are you disappointed or are you proud?
Haven't I done EVERYTHING, EVERYTHING?

I'm so sorry I'm so weak
And I turned into a freak
But I don't know ANYTHING, ANYTHING!

I've lost all self-esteem
Five billion, everything
And I feel NOTHING, NOTHING!

Oh god please tell me now
God please tell me now
'Cause I feel nothing

Oh dear god I'm writing this letter to you
I am coming unglued
Please help me.
