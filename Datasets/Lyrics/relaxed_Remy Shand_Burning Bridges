Another time, another place
Mark my word, I can't take another day of sadness
My heart's broken taken whole
And this dream is getting old
Yet I'm searchin' every part of me, baby

The tables turned, that's for sure
Guilt and honor have crossed over into what's left for holdin' on
You know things are getting hard
When we see them as they are
Can these qualities remain the same?

Woman, feeling good about the choice I made
In so deep there ain't no judgement day
If there was I think I'd be ok

Woman, Please release me from your hold tonight
Burning Bridges in the morning light
I'm just high on the city life

Oh I tried to tell you
But it's too late to find out
Hangin' on the back of my will
Waitin' for the moment to be still

Save your problems baby
Save your problems for the world
And they might go away, go away

I've been contemplatin'
Keepin' it complicated
For when you wanna turn the day in
And I just wanna turn the day around
I know it hurts a lot
But I gave what I got
Now I'll be gettin' on my way

Tried so hard to love you but I keep on runnin'
Burning Bridges in the morning light, morning light
