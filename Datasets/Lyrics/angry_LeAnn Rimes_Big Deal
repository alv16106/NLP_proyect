Well he used to be mine
Not so very long ago
I was crazy to ever let him get away
But girl you should know better
Then to go braggin' in my face
So forgive me, for what I'm 'bout to say

Big deal, so what, who cares
You just got lucky
That's all, it was, shut up
Don't want to hear another word about
Candlelight and long-stem roses
And how you're fallin' head-over-heels
In love, so what, big deal

He's perfect, I heard ya
The first ten times that you told me
Yeah... it's amazing, his lovin'
I can't believe I let him go...
I regret it (regret it), there I said it (I said it)
You call yourself a friend
But you just keep rubbin' it in

Big deal, so what, who cares
Ya just got lucky
That's all, it was, I swear
If I hear another word about
Candlelight and long-stem roses
And how you're fallin' head-over-heels
In love, so what, big deal

Con-great-u-la-tions I'm just
So happy for you
I can't contain the way I feel...

Big deal, big deal
So what, who cares
You just got lucky, that's all
It was, shut up
Don't want to hear another word about
Candle light and long-stem roses
And how you're fallin' head-over-heels
In love, so what, big deal

In love, so what, big deal

Uh-huh, it's a real big deal (big deal)
Hey-yeah
Ah, Ah it's a real big deal (big deal)
Oh-oh it's a real big deal

In love, so what, shut up
Oh, oh it's a real big deal
