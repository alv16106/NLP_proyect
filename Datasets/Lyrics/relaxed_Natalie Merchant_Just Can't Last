Well, I know I swear I know your face, I
Wish I knew your name, I
Wish I could take you by the hand
Well, if I could name it
If I could just explain it
If I could only help you
Help you understand

Well, I can, I can see that you're hurting
Weighed down like a beast of burden
About to break your back
God only knows that you're human
So what are they trying to do then?
Believe me, they don't understand

That you have the weight of the world today on your
It's on your back
A heavy load like that's gonna hold you back, gonna
It's gonna drag you down
You know it just can't last
It just can't
You know it just can't last
You know it just can't last
It just can't
You know it just can't last

Well, they thought they could use ya
Push you down and abuse ya
And that's so sad (Ooh)
Decided to hide all your feelings
Got more pain than you can deal with
But ask yourself, "how can this last?"

I know you have the weight of the world today on your
It's on your back
A heavy load like that is gonna hold you back, it's gonna
It's gonna drag you down
You know it just can't last
It just can't
You know it just can't last
You know it just can't last
It just can't
You know it just can't last

You know it just can't last
It just can't
You know it just can't last

You know it just can't last
It just can't
You know it just can't last

You know it just can't last
It just can't
You know it just can't last

You know it just can't last

You know it just can't (Ooh)
It just can't last (Ooh)
You know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know
They don't understand
You know that they
They don't understand
