-1st verse-
U touch me baby
Then you untouch me baby
U feed me your lies
Words like pie
U warned me baby
Then you unwarn me baby
Outsmart me baby
And I'm back, I'm crazy

But I should be ashamed
'Cause I let
U do me this way
And then it's un-
Fortunate that when you're in love
U never use...

Right side of your brain (eh)
Right side of your brain (eh)
Right side of your brain (eh)
Right side of your brain (eh)

Right side of your brain (eh)
Right side of your brain (eh)
Right side of your brain (eh)
Right side of your brain (eh)

-2nd verse-
U love me baby
Unlove me baby.
U lead me on then
U lock the doors on our home.
U heart me baby
Then your hardly baby.
U need me baby
Then you see me go.
U say I'm your friend
And U'll be there in the end.
Then you tell me baby
U sell me baby

But I should be ashamed
'Cause I let
You treat me this way
Can't lie, it's un-
Fortunate to say that love
Never lets me use...

The right side of my brain (eh)
Right side of my brain (eh)
Right side of my brain (eh)
Right side of my brain (eh)

Right side of my brain (eh)
Right side of my brain (eh)
Right side of my brain (eh)
Right side of my brain (eh)

Right side of my...

U love me baby
And you unlove me baby.
U watchin me dreamin'
Ur love has me feenin'.

And I nearly gave in.

What happened to the end?

But I should be ashamed
'Cause I let
U complain this way
And I know
