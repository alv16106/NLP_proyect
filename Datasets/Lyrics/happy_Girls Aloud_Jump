If you want more, more, more

Jump in and feel my touch
Jump, if you want to taste my kisses in the night then,
Jump, Jump for my love

Cheryl and Sarah:
I'm the only woman for you
Nobody does you like I do

Oh baby

And heaven waits here at my door
And if you want more,
If you want more, more, more
