Whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

Well, we can't take it this week
And her friends don't want another speech
Hoping for a better day
To hear what she's got to say

All about that personality crisis, you got it while it was hot
But now frustration and heartache's what you got
That's why they talk about personality

But now you're trying to be something, now you got to do something
Want to be someone who cow wow wows
But you think about the times you did, they took every ounce

When it sure got to be a shame when you start to scream and shout
You got to contradict all those times you butterflied about
You was butterflying

About a personality crisis, you got it while it was hot
But now, don't you know it, frustration and heartache's what you got
And now I know, I'm sure they talk about personality, yeah, yeah, yeah

And you're a prima ballerina on a spring afternoon
Change on into the wolfman, howling at the moon, ah-woo

About a personality crisis, you got it while it was hot
But now, don't you know it, frustration and heartache's what you got
And now I know, I'm sure they talk about personality (about personality)
(Say it, say it, yeah)

Now with all the crossing fingers, Mother Nature says
Your mirror's gettin' jammed up with all your friends
That personality, everything is startin' to blend, nuh-uh, but what, what

Personality, when your mind starts to bend
It's another personality, impression of a friend
Of a friend of a friend of a friend of a friend
Personality, wondering how celebrities ever mend
Looking fine on television

Personality crisis, you got it while it was hot
And now, don't you know it, frustration and heartache is all you got
Oh, don't you worry

Personality crisis, please don't cry (don't you worry)
It's just a personality crisis, please don't stop
Because you walk a personality
Talk a personality
