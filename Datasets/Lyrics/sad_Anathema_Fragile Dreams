Countless times I trusted you
I let you back in
Knowing, yearning
You know I should have run but I
I Stayed

Maybe I always knew
My fragile dreams would be broken
For you

Today I introduced myself
To my own feelings
In silent agony 
After all these years they spoke to me
After all these years

Maybe I always knew
My fragile dreams would be broken
For you
