Yeah Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Whoa yeah talkin' 'bout my baby
Talkin' 'bout my baby
When she goes walkin' down bourban street
I just can't hardly stand to walk behind her
She's got a red hot pants on
She got on her yellow high heeled sneakers
She got on a yellow low neck see through blouse
Without her brasier on
She's shakin like two big ole baloons in a hurricane
Ooh, she's got on a purple afro wig
She got a hand on her hip,
Lettin' her back bone slip
Battin her eye, battin her eye
Battin her eye, battin her eye
Battin her eye 'n' lookin' straight at me,
Yeah, lookin' straight at me
She's battin her eyes and lookin' straight at me
With that sassy, saucy look on her face
Shit son yeah.
I want to go out on a picnic with you baby,
Out under the big bright yellow sun
She said I wanna go out on a picnic with you baby
Out under the big bright yellow sun
Under the big bright yellow sun
(Repeat to fade out)
