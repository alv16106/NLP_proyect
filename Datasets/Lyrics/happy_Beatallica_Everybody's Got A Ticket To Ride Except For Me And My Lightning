C'mon, it's such a joy, c'mon you metal boy 
C'mon let's take it easy 
C'mon let's make it sleazy 
Everybody's got a ticket to ride 
Except for me and my lightning 
Your insides ooze out, the electrodes are in 
The electrodes are in so your eyeballs pop out 
Someone controlling me 
Can't be happening to me 
Sweat-chilling cold, I watch death unfold 
How true is this? Get it over with 
I think I'm gonna be dead, I think it's today 
Electric wires pinned to my head, I'm frying away 
I've got a ticket to ride the lightning 
Death is in the air, it's bringing me down 
Strapped in the electric chair, death is all around 
Before I get to riding so high 
Someone help me, oh please God help me 
Flashing before my eyes 
Someone help me, oh please God help me 
Wakened by horrid scream burning in my brain 
Freed from this frightening dream 
I can feel the flame
