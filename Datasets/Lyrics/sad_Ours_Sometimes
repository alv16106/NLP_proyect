Pressure fried the coldest head
Bent to the side wishing he was dead
And I would still defend
I would still defend

I'll give up on it all
I'll give up on the greed
I'll give up on the ones
Who give up on me

Held up by the poor somewhere
They're unaware but I know we are scared
If I was to give in the fight would soon begin... begin

So I'll give up on it all
I'll give up on the greed
I'll give up on the ones
Who'll give up on me

Sometimes sun shines
Sun shines
Sometimes the sun shines
Sun shines

Did you give up on it all
Did you give up on the greed
Did you give up on the ones
Who gave up on me
