I shake my head and shiver; they smile and then stab my back as they shake my hand
Send out an SOS plea; come quickly, I'm marooned in Monkeyland
Is there anyone there who understands me? Anyone at all

I'm idly staring at the sky. Did anybody hear me sigh?
A million stars, a moving sight. To all you out there hearing me tonight

It's just a trick of the light. Yeah, it's just a trick of the light

I have to know what is real and what is illusion
Oh, how does it feel beyond this confusion? Is there anyone there?

Do I dismiss this with a sigh? (Oh yes, you must from time to time)
And let the answers pass me by (no questions set to bend the mind)
Is my creator a God or a man? (yes, yours too). Does someone somewhere care or understand?

It's just a trick of the light. Yeah, it's just a trick of the light

I have to know what is real and what is illusion
Tell me how does it feel beyond this confusion?

For all the tricks of the light. Yeah, for all the tricks of the light out there tonight, tonight

I have to know what is real and what is illusion
Oh, how does it feel beyond this confusion? Is there anyone there?
Oh, is there anyone there?
Life's an optical illusion. Like other optical illusions, oh, beware
Oh, beware
There it goes again
