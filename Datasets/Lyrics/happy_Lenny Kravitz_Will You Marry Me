I want to do this thing 
I don't want no drama mama 
It's love I bring 

Ooh, wait a minute 
You're out of sight 
Girl, I wanna give it to you 
Let's make it right 

You 
You are my life and my passion 
That never goes out of fashion 
I want to know 
Will you marry me? 

Hey baby 
Will you wear my ring? 
You're a queen and I've been waiting 
To be a king 

Baby, baby 
Let's keep it tight 
If you want to get right to it 
Could be tonight 

You 
You are my life and my passion 
That never goes out of fashion 
I want to know 
Will you marry me? 

Ooh 
Come on baby 
Keep it tight 
I know its right 
I wanna have you always in my life 

Hit it 

Oh yeah 
No, I like that 
Do that one more time 

You
