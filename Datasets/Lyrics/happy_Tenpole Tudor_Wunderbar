Eins zwei deux trois!

There is unemployment misery despair
Really want to leave my trouble I'm going to the fair
Love is getting rough oh yes I know
Excuse me but I've got to go

There is a word in German and I think it says it all

Wunderbar wunderbar wunderbar wunderbar 2x
Wunderbar

You run the risk of being a bore
Tell me all about that nuclear war
I don't wanna sing to the fuhrer
God knows!
