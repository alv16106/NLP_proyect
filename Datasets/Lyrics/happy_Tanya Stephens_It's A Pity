I said if we never get a chance to be together
Go with Jah, Tanya loves ya, wha me seh?

It's a pity you already have a wife
And me done have a man inna mi life
Rudeboy it's such a pity
I say it is such a pity you already have yuh wife
And me have a one man inna mi life
Rudeboy it is a pity, mm mm mm

I woulda like one of these mornings to wake up and find
Your face on a pillow lying right next to mine
I woulda cut out the partying the smoking and the rum
And buss a extra wine and make we seal up a son
Well every time mi fantasize me see your lips me see your eyes
Your trigger finger do something a lef the rudegirl hypnotized
For you it's just a thing, just another little fling
But for me this is Heaven and the angel them a sing

(Repeat hook)

Fi buck you up inna public and can't even touch
It really fuck me up because me check fi you so much
The respect weh mi have fi your woman fi your kids
Believe me rudeboy mi criss, a nuh matey this
Who knows? maybe one day the world will be evolved enough
We'll share you in a civilized manner between the two of us
But until then I woulda love see you again,
Me know we have fi play it by the stupid rules of men

(Repeat intro)

So meet me round the corner, avoid Mitzy and Lorna
You know them a two of the biggest informer
I'm not starving for sex no, nah bawl out 'next!' no
But the way how yuh flex really pique my interest yo
The you weh people see a no the you weh me loving
And the you weh deh with me go much deeper than skin
I don't know exactly what it is you're feeling
But I wish this was a permanent thing

(Repeat hook)

Me know seh you belong to she, you know seh me belong to him
Me wouldn't want you dis your queen, me woulda never dis mi king
But when yuh play pon mi riddim and when me feel your base a swing
You lef me inna turmoil, you have me head a spin
It really mek me sad fi haffi waste so much water,
I think the two o' we can mek a beautiful daughter
But it would be selfish to an innocent little youth
Fi bring her come and cannot tell her the truth
We have fi tell her the truth
