Take off your head to let me in
So I can understand you
Take off your hands so I can feel
If there is anything left inside you

Remember to smile
While I cut out what's bad inside of you
Remember to cry, to pretend you're alive
While I hide inside of you

Sections of life
Reflections of pain
In this mirror, we all
Look the same

How can I see what you are
When you're not anything that I am?
How can you be what I was
When it's something you could never understand?
