Caught
Now You're Mine
I am the master of your whipping time
The smile
On my lips
The look of horror on your face
Self
Justification
Can't rid the sexual fascination
Can
You deny
My face of pleasure the gleam in my eye

You're nothing
An object of animation
A subjective mannequin
Beaten into submission
Raping again and again

Shackled
My Princess
Dangling in distress
Here
To discipline
My sole purpose never ends
Bleeding
On Your knees
My satisfaction is what I need
The urge
To take my fist
And violate every orifice

You're nothing
An object of animation
A subjective mannequin
Beaten into submission
Raping again and again

Slaves to my torments
Scream to your heart's content
Time and time again
Pleasure in inflicting pain
Power so intense
Trying to circumvent
Unadulterated battery
Manipulated reality
God is dead I am alive
