My mother wuz a witch, burned alive-ooh!
And if she ain't my bitch, you'd cry tears too
I'm evil

Now of revenge I sing, most evilly
The shit on you I'll bring, most metally
And I'm evil

Vengeance like mine could never die
As long as my metal's in me

Black is my Misfits shirt, I've 20 Eyes
Sleeveless shirt full of dirt says "Darling Die"
And I'm evil

Vengeance like mine could never die
As long as my metal's in me

Black is my Misfits shirt, I've 20 Eyes
Misfits shirt full of fucking dirt
Says "Darling Die"
And I'm evil

And I'm evil-yes, I am
And I'm evil-I am man
And I'm evil-yes, I fuckin' am!
