Now I'm lost, now I'm lost
Now I'm lost, now I'm lost

Last night, I heard lepers
Flinch like birth defects
Its musk was fecal in origin as the words dribbled off of its chin
It said, "I'm lost, I'm lost"
Now I'm lost, now I'm lost

Now I'm lost, now I'm lost
Now I'm lost, now I'm lost

Dolls wreck the minced meat of pupils
Cast in oblong arms length
The hooks have been picking their scabs where wolves hide in the company of men
Which said, "I'm lost, I'm lost"

Now I'm lost, now I'm lost
Now I'm lost, now I'm lost

Now I'm lost, now I'm lost

Are you peeking in the red?
Perforated at the neck

What of this mongrel architect?
A broken arm of soon will set
Past, present, and future tense
Clipside of the pinkeye fountain
What of this mongrel architect?
A broken arm of soon will set
Past, present, and future tense
Clipside of the pinkeye fountain

Now I'm lost, now I'm lost
Now I'm lost, now I'm lost

It's been said a long time ago
You'll be the first and last to know

You'll never know
You'll never know
You'll never know
You'll never know
