Do you applaud fear
Do you hold it near
Are you afraid to live your life
The way I perceive
In my arms I'll catch you
Do you mind If I always love you

Heaven's gonna burn your eyes

You'll see
In my dream I'll catch you
Into my arms I'll catch you
Do you mind if I always love you

Heaven's gonna burn your eyes
