Let's do it

Workin all week
Nine to five for my money
So, when the weekend comes
I go get live with the honey
Rollin down the street
I saw this girl and she was pumpin
I winked my eye, she got into the ride
Went to a club, we're jumpin
Introduced myself as Loc
She said, "You're a liar" 
I said, "I got it goin on baby doll,
and I'm on fire"
Took her to the hotel
She said, "You're the king"
I said, "Be my queen, if you know what I mean,
and let us do the wild thing"

Wild thing
Wild thing

Shoppin at the mall
Lookin for some gear to buy
I saw this girl, she cool rocked my world
And I had to adjust my fly
She looked at me and smiled and said,
"You have plans for the night?"
I said, "Hopefully if things go well
I'll be with you tonight"
So, we journeyed to her house
One thing led to another
I keyed the door, I cold hit the floor
Looked up and it was her mother
I didn't know what to say
I was hanging by a string
She said, "Hey you two, I was once like you
and I liked to do the wild thing"

Wild thing
She loved to do the wild thing
Wild thing
Please baby baby please

Posse in effect
Hangin out is always hype 
And when me and the crew leave a shindig
I want a girl who's just my type
Saw this luscious little frame
I ain't lyin fellas, she was fine
The sweet young miss cold gave me a kiss
And I knew that she was mine
Took her to the limousine
It's still parked outside
I tipped the chauffeur when it was over
And I gave her my own ride
Couldn't get her off my jock
She was like static cling
But that's what happens when body start slappin
From doin the wild thing

Wild thing
She wanna do the wild thing
Please baby baby please

Wild thing

Doin a little show
At the local discotheque
This fine young chick was on my jock
So, I said, "what the heck?"
She wanted to come on stage
And do her little dance
So, I said chill for now
But maybe later you'll get your chance
So, when the show was finished
I took her around the way
And what do you know she was good to go
Without a word to say 
We was all alone and she said, 
"Tone let me tell you one thing 
I need fifty dollars to make you holler
I get paid to do the wild thing"

Say what?
Yo, love you must be kiddin
You're walkin, babe
Just break outta here 
Hasta la vista, baby

Wild thing
