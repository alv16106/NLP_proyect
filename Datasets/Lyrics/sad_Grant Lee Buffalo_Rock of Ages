Rock of Ages
I am tumbling down
Where the roots of trees
Embrace you 
I do fall upon my knees 
And ask you how
You can just sit there and be 

Rock of Ages
I am crumbling now
In an avalanche
I'm reaching for the Rock of Ages
Rock of Ages
Rock of Ages

Father now I have stepped
Beyond my bounds
Now the pack I wear 
It weighs a thousand pounds
It drags me down
Makes me think crazy

Oh my Rock of Ages 
I have gone astray
I heard my brother call 
I turned the other way
Now I'm ashamed
To face him

Oh my Rock of Ages
Rock of Ages
Oh my Rock of Ages
Rock of Ages
Reach for the Rock of Ages
Rock of Ages
In the avalanche
In the avalanche
Heavy rock
And I reach for the rock
I reach for the rock
In the avalanche it falls
I reach for the rock
I reach for the rock
I reach for the rock
In the avalanche
In the avalanche
Heavy rock
Heavy rock
Such a heavy rock
