There'll come a time when you know just what you feel
I'm dancing inside, that you know just what is real
Here in the sound there's a magic in the air
You've got to let it out, let it show you really care

Sweet sweet sweet love
I need your sweet sweet love

If it's all right, there is something here to dream
Now that you've for a heaven, could you find it here with me?
Deep down inside I know you feel the way that I do
No need to live without, the sweeter love I found in you

Come down, take a look around
There's a sweeter love
Take me there, take me down
You've got nothing to be guilty of
Of sweeter love
Let it out
Let it out

Come down, take a look around
There's a sweeter love
Take me there, take me down
You've got nothing to be guilty of
Of sweeter love
Let it out
Let it out
