Maybe I'm a joker

Maybe I'm a fool in your eyes

Maybe I'm the weak one

Maybe I'm a lie in disguise

Maybe I'm angry 'cause I'm the one who's always wrong

Maybe I'm not the one who's so strong

Did you think about it?

Did you pour it in and pull it out?

Could you live without me?

Did you ever really have a doubt?

Do you understand it, baby,

When you say "It's over, it's done"?

Maybe I'm not the one

So if you're gonna leave

Yeah, you better get goin'

'Cause I ain't wastin' no more time

What you did and what you didn't

So if you're gonna leave

Yeah, you better start runnin'

'Cause I ain't wastin' no more time

On what mighta been

We can stand on reason

We can fight about all the things

This isn't forever

This is more than a wedding ring

But do you understand it, baby,

When you say "It's over, it's done"?

Whoa, did it happen again?

With the things that you wanted for being a friend

How did it happen again?

Just look onward, baby

Someday you might need a friend

So if you're gonna leave

You better get goin'

'Cause I ain't wastin' no more time

With what we did and what we didn't

So if you're gonna leave

Yeah, you better start runnin'

'Cause I ain't wastin' no more time

No, I ain't wastin no more time

On what mighta been
