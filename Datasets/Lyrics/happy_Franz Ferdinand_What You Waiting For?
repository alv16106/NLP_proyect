Tick-tock, tick-tock
Tick-tock, tick-tock
Tick-tock, tick-tock
Tick-tock, tick-tock
La, la, la, la, la, la, la

Like a cat in heat, stuck in a moving car
A scary conversation, shut my eyes, can't find the brake
What if they say that you're a quitter?
Naturally, I'm worried if I do it alone
Who really cares, 'cause it's your life
You never know, it could be great
Take a chance 'cause you might grow
Oh, oh!

What you waiting
What you waiting
What you waiting
What you waiting
What you waiting for?!

What you waiting
What you waiting
What you waiting
What you waiting
What you waiting for?!

Tick-tock, tick-tock
Tick-tock, tick-tock
Take a chance you stupid ho!

Like an echo pedal, you're repeating yourself
You know it all by heart
Why are you standing in one place?
Born to blossom, bloom to perish
Know your wigging out 'cause of your sex chromozone
I know it's so messed up, how our society all thinks (for sure)
Life is short, you're capable

Oh, oh!
Look at your watch now
You're still a super hot female
You got your million-dollar contract
And they're all waiting for your hot track

What you waiting
What you waiting
What you waiting, waiting
Whatcha, What you waiting
What you waiting for?!

What you waiting
What you waiting
What you waiting
What you waiting, waiting
What you waiting for?!

Take me to Japan
Give me lots of brand new fans
Osaka, Tokyo
You Harajuku girls
Damn, you've got some wicked style, Go!

Look at your watch now
You're still a super hot female
You got your million-dollar contract
And they're all waiting for your hot track

What you waiting
What you waiting
What you waiting
What you waiting
What you waiting for?!

What you waiting
What you waiting
What you waiting
What you waiting
What you waiting for?!

Well, it's a nice day for a White Wedding
Whoa!
Well, it's a nice day to start again

Well, it's a nice day for a White Wedding
Well, it's a nice day to, start again

Tick-tock, tick-tock
Tick-tock, tick-tock
Tick-tock, tick-tock
Tick-tock, tick-tock, Tick!
