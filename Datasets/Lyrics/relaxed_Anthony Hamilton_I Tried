Tried

Tried for so long / for you to hold on
But you won't be long / to anyone
Any thang, any love / at all

I thought we had it all / until things started to recede
Giving me no love at all / not caring enough about my needs
Gave you my heart and all my soul / but not once did I let go
And I tried / to stick by you / and I tried to call / to let you know
That I'm here for you / and I'm give my all

Tried for so long / for you to hold on
But you want belong / to anyone
Any thang, any love / at all

You had the best love of you life
But you didn't treat it right / no you didn't / no you didn't girl
To busy running out all night long / didn't even have the decency to just
Pick up the telephone / and just call me / and let me know where you were
And that your all right / so I can sleep at night / girl you showed out so
Had the nerve to break up our happy home / all I wanna do / is do for you

Tried for so long / for you to hold on
But you want be long / to anyone
Any thang, any love / at all

I stood by your side / sheltered for you / when things were down
I help pull you through / Faithful and all / trusting and warm / but you took heart by storm
