Now that everybody's here
Could we please have your attention?
There is nothing left to fear
No, now that Bigfoot is captured
But are the children really right, all right, all right?
But are the children really right, all right, all right?
Now are the children all all right?

There is danger in the night
There are things we can't control, but
Will we give ourselves a fright
When we become less than human?
There are people who say why, oh, why, oh, why?
Now there are other ways to die, oh, why, oh, why, oh, why, oh, why?

But upon this tidal wave
Oh, God, oh, God
But upon this tidal wave
Oh, God, oh, God
Of young blood, young blood, young blood, young blood
Young blood, young blood, young blood, young blood

We are men who stay alive
Who send your children away now
We are calling from a tower
Expressing what must be
Everyone's opinion
They are going out to bars
And they are getting into cars
I have seen them with my own eyes
America, please help them

Now, they are child stars, child stars, child stars, child stars
Child stars, child stars, child stars, child stars
Child stars, child stars, child stars, child stars
Child stars, child stars, child stars, child stars
Child stars, child stars, child stars, child stars
Child stars, child stars, child stars, child stars
Child stars, child stars, child stars, child stars
Child stars, child stars
With their sex
And their drugs
And their rock and rock and rock and rock and roll
Hey
