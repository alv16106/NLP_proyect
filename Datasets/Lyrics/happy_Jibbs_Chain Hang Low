Do your chain hang low
Do it wobble to da flo
Do it shinin' in the light
Is it platinum is it gold
Could you throw it ov'r ya shoulda
If ya hot it make ya cold
Do your chain hang low

Is that your chain!
Bout 24 inches is how low I let it hang
How 'bout the ride 'n' let the diamonds smoke off the range
Just by the chain you can tell the big kid do a stain
U know the name,

Bout 24 inches iz how low I let it hang
How 'bout the ride 'n' let the diamonds smoke off the range
Just by the chain you can tell a big kid do a stain

Chains so low you would think that diamonds never stop it
And its funny cause you could never stop it
A bunch of rocks on my hand n I ain't even on the block yet
Show 'em white gold sorta hold 'em like my tims
And a chain hang 24 inches like the rims
Diamonds all blown up yeah sorta like a pimp
So when I like hit the ice
It starts glistenin off the tims (off the tims)

My chain hang
All it do iz blang blang,
Have blue have red
Like my diamonds gang bang
And don evn thank
We on tha same thing
Charms so heavy they couldn' lift it till the crane came
