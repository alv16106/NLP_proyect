Louie
I just got a warning and I know and I know
Louie
I know I'm always drunk as drunk as can be
But I wonder, Louie, have you got room for me
I just wonder Louie, have you got room for me
Louie

I just got a warning and I know and I know
Louie
I know I'm always drunk as drunk as can be
But I wonder, Louie, have you got room for me
I just wonder Louie, have you got room for me

Louie
I just got a warning and I know and I know
Louie
They gonna throw me out when the morning comes
And I wonder Louie - have you got room for me
I just wonder Louie - have you got room for me

Oh, nobody know
Why some are born
With empty holes
Like twisted souls

Louie
I just got a warning and I know and I know
Louie
I know I'm always drunk as drunk as can be
But I wonder, Louie, have you got room for me
I just wonder Louie, have you got room for me Louie

Louie
I just got a warning and I know and I know
Louie
I know I'm always drunk as drunk can be
But I wonder, Louie, have you got room for me
I just wonder Louie, have you got room for me Louie
