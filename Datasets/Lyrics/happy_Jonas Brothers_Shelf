He's such a flirt
And I am the lonely heart
Give it a chance
For our love to start
But you'll never see
If you don't give me a shot
To show you what I got

But it's too late
To pretend
You know me better
Than I know myself
Don't take my heart
And put it on a shelf
Always someone else
The next girl who will
Make your cold heart melt
I'm gonna give my love
To someone else

I held your hand
It felt like a movie
I made some plans
But you were
Already moving on
Now I'm stuck
Under a rainy cloud
But you
Don't seem to care
But it's all right
'Cause

It's too late
To pretend
You know me better
Than I know myself
Don't take my heart
And put it on a shelf
Always someone else
The next girl who will
Make your cold heart melt
I'm gonna give my love
To someone else

I'm tired
Of wasting all my time
My heart
Is hanging on the line
Is it me, boy?
Or someone else?
Please take me off the shelf

Too late
To pretend
You know me better
Than I know myself
Don't take my heart
And put it on a shelf

La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la

(Everybody!)

Always someone else
The next girl
Who will make
Your cold heart melt
I'm gonna give my love
To someone else
Yeah
