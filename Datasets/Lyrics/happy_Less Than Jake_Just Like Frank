He's just like anyone
He's just like anybody
Just like anyone
He's just like frank
And I know it
And he knows it
It's his one sided point of view
I know it when he says
It's my way, or the wrong way
And I don't care about you
But to see my side wouldn't be the worst thing he could do
When someone's politic blinds you
And binds you
To something you don't believe in
And he's just like anyone...
And I saw him walking on my way
Path third street just the other day
Why doesn't he understand views keep changing?
