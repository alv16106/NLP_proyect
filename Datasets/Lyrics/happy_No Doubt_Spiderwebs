You think that we connect
That the chemistry's correct
Your words walk right through my ears
Presuming I like what I hear

And now I'm stuck in the web
You're spinning
You got me for your prey

Sorry I'm not home right now
I'm walking into spiderwebs
So leave a message
And I'll call you back
A likely story, but leave a message
And I'll call you back

You're intruding on what's mine
And you're taking up my time
Don't have the courage inside me
To tell you please let me be

Communication, a telephonic invasion
I'm planning my escape

Sorry I'm not home right now
I'm walking into spiderwebs
So leave a message
And I'll call you back
A likely story, but leave a message
And I'll call you back

And it's all your fault
I screen my phone calls
No matter who calls
I gotta screen my phone calls

Now it's gone too deep (now it's gone too deep)
You wake me in my sleep (wake me in my sleep)
My dreams become nightmares (dreams become nightmares)
'Cause you're ringing in my ears
Oh

Sorry I'm not home right now
I'm walking into spiderwebs
So leave a message
And I'll call you back
A likely story, but leave a message
And I'll call you back

And it's all your fault
I screen my phone calls
No matter, matter, matter, matter who calls
I gotta screen my phone calls

Ooh, spiderwebs
Leave a message
And I'll call you back
I'm walking into spiderwebs
So leave a message
And I'll call you back

It's all your fault
I screen my phone calls
No matter, matter, matter who calls
I gotta screen my phone calls

It's all your fault
It's all your fault
No matter who calls
No matter who calls
Oh

I'm walking into spiderwebs
So leave a message
And I'll call you back
I'm walking into spiderwebs
A-leave a message
And I'll call you back

Oh
It's all your fault
(I'm walking into spiderwebs)
No matter who calls
(Leave a message, and I'll call you back)
I gotta screen my phone calls
(I'm walking into spiderwebs)
It's all your fault
(Leave a message, and I'll call you back)

No matter, matter, matter who calls
(I'm walking into spiderwebs)
I screen my phone calls
(Leave a message, and I'll call you back)
I'm walking into spiderwebs
Leave a message
And I'll call you back
