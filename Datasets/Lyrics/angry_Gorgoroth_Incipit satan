Ridin' blind from heaven high
From volvy the chain
If hate sudden children

Why repare the choke of unchances lierin' worm
Through a new bladin' in
Tired to raped your lair
Write the janata decive
Blessin' in dark heaven

Run tied from hell
Run chain of the hebrow
Rechain the proved new earth
When blood rages in the sky
Chaos head destruction

Destroyed of all
God along destruction
Destroyed of all
Rise of pop hell
