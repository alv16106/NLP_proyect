I'm not gonna say
Do you ever stop to think along the way?
But, baby, be prepared to be surprised
Better be prepared to be surprised
Baby, be prepared to be surprised
It's all I know

I'm not gonna state
Obvious observations everybody makes
But baby, be prepared to be surprised
Better be prepared to be surprised
Baby, be prepared to be surprised
It's all I know

The weight of the world
And the hurt and the dirt
Can make you disturbed
But I heard, but I heard

When I wrap my arms around you
Every mistake we made crumbles
When I wrap my arms around you
Everything echoes a new song

I'm not gonna whine
To scream, "I'm so tired" through a mic
Baby, be prepared to be surprised
Better be prepared to be surprised
Baby be prepared to be surprised
It's all I know

The weight of the world
And the hurt and the dirt
Can make you disturbed
But I heard, but I heard

When I wrap my arms around you
Every mistake we make crumbles
When I wrap my arms around you
Everything echoes a new song

I'm not gonna lie
Saying everyone will be all right
And fine until we die
What else can you do but hope and pray
And say that we'll get by

Be prepared to be surprised
Better be prepared to be surprised
Baby, be prepared to be surprised
Better be prepared to be surprised
It's all I know
