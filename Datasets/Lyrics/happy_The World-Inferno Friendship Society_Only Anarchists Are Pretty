If we should be arrested before we sleep
I'll see you outside in a few days or in a few weeks
And if you should be shot trying to escape
I'll know that for the lie that's written on its face
And if we don't live to be old and faint
It will be because we got lazy and forgot to get away

When we were young, you were the best thing going
And I struggled mightily to keep my hands to myself
Watching you strut down the street telling everyone to go to hell

With a flash of the ankle, snarl of the lip
I see you in the street and gasp

A lot of gossip and glances, I'd had enough
I grasped you gently by your arm and said,
"Hey, I got a crush"
You caught both my eyes and you gave me a push
You said, "Hey, you got one back"
And the room caved in

With a flash of the ankle, snarl of the lip
I see you in the street and gasp
'Cause Only Anarchists Are
Only Anarchists Are
Only Anarchists Are Pretty

After a lot of gossip and glances,
Your boyfriend got upset
He punched me squarely in my snout and said,
"Hey! You got a debt!"
I turned my eyes into slits and I gave him a kick
I said, "Hey! You want one back?"
And the room caved in

With a flash of the ankle,
Snarl of the lip I see you in the street and gasp

'Cause Only Anarchists Are
Only Anarchists Are
Only Anarchists Are Pretty
