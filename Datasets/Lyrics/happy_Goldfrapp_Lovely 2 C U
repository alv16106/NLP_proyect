A wonderful place to be
The birds are singing
The dreams that are sent to me
Everyone's waving

But there's no noises
The smell of your skin
The glittering lights of Hell
I'm missing sin

La Lovely 2 See U
La Lovely 2 See U

I wanna get out of here
Inhale your sky
A beautiful place to be
So I don't know why
They're selling us something
I don't need
They're selling us something, babe
You shouldn't believe
