There's no reason
There's no compromise
Changin' seasons
Livin' the high life

I don't know you
So don't freak on me
I can't control you
You're not my destiny

Straight out of line
I can't find a reason
Why I should justify my ways
Straight out of line
I don't need a reason
You don't need to lie to me

I'll confess this
You're my tragedy
I've laid you to rest
Just as fast as you've turned on me

Gone forever
Banish the memories
Displays of pleasure
Are masked by your misery

Straight out of line
I can't find a reason
Why I should justify my ways
Straight out of line
I don't need a reason
You don't need to lie to me
Lie to me

Straight out of line
I can't find a reason
Why I should justify my ways
Straight out of line
I don't need a reason
You don't need to, don't need to lie to me

Lie to me
Lie to me
Lie to me
