I'm obssesed and deranged
For I am destined to rule
And I just can't believe
That you are such a fool

I don't want your sweet devotion
I don't need your cheap emotion
You will do as you are told
'Til the rights to you are sold

Don't blow your top
Are you hung up?

Think I go and start my car
To have a real adventure
Like some Czecky little creap
Really dick her, she's so freaky

Once you were my one and only
Took my stash and left me lonely

Don't blow your top
Are you hung up?

Give me your dirty love
