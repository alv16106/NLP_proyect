Man, I just saw something. I'm glad that you are here.
I got to start to thinking, and seeing things so clear.
'Cause now how could I forget what she left?
What happened in November is what I needed.
And I'm sorry that it shows, but life ain't so bad you know?

And now the sky is such a sweet blue,
And you made this come true,
And my heart feels so new.
(Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa, whoa, whoa-oh)
It's now wonderful to see beautiful views
Like skies that are so blue.
(Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa, whoa, whoa-oh)

I'll never leave this you know.

I'd turn it off for this.
It looks like we got what we wished.
It snowed in Texas but you missed (first time since '86)
And I can't stop thinking how wonderful this is.
And I'm sorry I sound glad, but why always be so sad?

And now the sky is such a sweet blue,
And you made this come true,
And my heart feels so new.
(Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa, whoa, whoa-oh)
It's now wonderful to see beautiful views
Like skies that are so blue.
(Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa, whoa, whoa-oh)

And I know that sometimes oh I might feel alone, so broke, and cold.
But now I'll show that I know
That the sky is such a sweet blue,
And you made this come true,
And my heart feels so new.
(Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa, whoa, whoa-oh)
It's now wonderful to see beautiful views
Like skies that are so blue.
(Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa, whoa, whoa-oh)

I'll never leave this you know.
