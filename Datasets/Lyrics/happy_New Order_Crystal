We're like crystal (Hey)
We break easy (Hoo)
I'm a poor man (Hey)
If you leave me (Hoo)
I'm applauded (Hey)
Then forgotten
It was summer (Hey)
Now it's autumn (Hoo)

I don't know what to say
You don't care anyway
I'm a man in a rage
With a girl I betrayed
Here comes love, it's like honey
You can't buy it with money
You're not alone anymore
You shook me to the core
You shook me to the core

(Hoo)
(Hey)
We're like crystal
It's not easy (Hoo)
With your love (Hey)
You can't beat me (Hoo)
Every man (Every man)
And every woman (And every woman)
Needs someone (Hey)
So keep it comin', keep it comin', keep it comin'
Keep it comin', keep it comin', keep it comin'

I don't know what to say
You don't care anyway
I'm a man in a rage
With a girl I betrayed
Here comes love, it's like honey
You can't buy it with money
You're not alone anymore
You shook me to the core
You shook me to the core
You shook me to the core
