We talked all night about suicide and she said
If this is living, how come I never feel alive?
The first time you're there, it really gets you up
Second times are all right
But it's just not enough, no
It shoots through your veins
Tears all your nerves apart
Well you get it and go, you get it and go
You know it's all right, you know it's all right
You get it and go, you get it and go
You get a little high, you get a little low

I've seen you dance so many times
You had your hands in your pockets, she said
I just got this message on my phone
And it's blowing my mind
You know it's tearing me up inside out

Strangles me, strangles me, you know
First time you're there, it really gets you up
Second times are all right
But it's the second circle of hell in your mind
It shoots through your veins
And tears all your nerves a-a-a-apart

Just get it and go, just get it and go
You know it's all right, you know it's all right
Just get it and go, just get it and go
You get a little high, you get a little low
You get it and go, you get it and go
You know it's all right, you know it's all right
You get it and go, you get it and go
You get a little high, and you get a little low

Well if it's all so hard
Why don't you slide on down with me?
And if you're hanging on my words, yeah
Well that's all right with me
Because it's just so easy
And we'll be all rare

You get it and go, you get it and go
You know it's all right, you know it's all right
You get it and go, you get it and go
You get a little high, you get a little low
You get it and go, you get it and go
You get it and go, you get it and go
You know it's all right, you know it's all right

Count your fingers one to four
1-2-3-4 and that's it
