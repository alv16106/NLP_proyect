She lived on the curve in the road
In an old tar paper shack
On the south side of the town
On the wrong side of the tracks

Sometimes on the way into town
We'd say, "Mama can we stop and give her a ride?"
Sometimes we did
But her hands flew from her side
Wild eyed Crazy Mary

Down the long dirt road, past the parson's place
That old blue car we used to race
Little country store with a sign tacked to the side
Said "No L-O-I-T-E-R-I-N-G Allowed"
Underneath that sign always congregated quite a crowd.

Take a bottle drink it down, pass it around
Take a bottle drink it down, drink it
Pass it around, pass it a-
A-take a bottle drink it down, pass it
Pass it a-, pass it around

One night thunder cracked
Mercy backed outside her windowsill
Dreamed I was flying high above the trees, over the hills
Looked down into the house of Mary
Terrible thoughts, newspaper covered walls
And Mary rising up above it all

Oh
Oh
Oh

Next morning on the way into town
Saw some skid marks and followed them around
Over the curve
Through the fields
Into the house of Mary

That what you fear the most could meet you halfway
That what you fear the most could meet you halfway

Take a bottle drink it down, pass it around
Take a bottle drink it down, pass it a-, pass it around
Take a bottle drink it down, pass it a-, pass it around

Yeah
Pass it a-
Pass it around
Pass it a-, pass it a-
