Tonight I'm dreaming,
And I wish to stay there forever
My lungs are empty
And right now I want to scream, I want to scream...

And tonight I'm telling you
Everything I'm never ever
Gonna regret this
Never ever...

My head is spinning
And it's been like this forever
And my conscience is breaking up
And that conflict is coming back,
It's coming back...

And tonight I'm telling you
Everything I'm never ever
Gonna regret this
Never ever...

Never ever...

And tonight I'm telling you
Everything I'm never ever
Gonna regret this
Never ever...

Tonight I'll tell you this
I'll never gonna forget this
Never ever...
