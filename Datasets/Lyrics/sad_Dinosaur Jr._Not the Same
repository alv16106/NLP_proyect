On this day where you're so messed it's clear
Can't explain the road you roam
Anyone who's been

As I walk with you,
It chills me so
To hear you say it's come to this, tell me this I care.

In a dream I always talk to you
You seem fine again, my sweet
Feels all right to me Is it right for you?

Flippin' out I try to call to you
Till you come to me
Tell me what to do

And I know it's not the same, there's no blame
-Still I bother you-
And you say it's not true, dear, it's mine to fear
-Follow on through-

Come alive I know you'll sing with me
I won't sing to you
It's not a thing I do

Has it been a different feel for you?
Whole time this was goin' on
Or is it something new?

And I know it's not the same, there's no blame
-Still I bother you-
And you say it's not true, dear, it's mine to fear
-We won't coexist-
Any way you're not the same, it's the blame
-Follow on through-

It's a lingering that comes to me
Does it come to you?
Are we really through?

Any guy would do this thing for me
It's not much to ask
Why can't you?

I'm not gonna say I've had my way
You sure saw to that
What else can I do?

You promised so much, lied with every touch
I believed in you.
Follow along through.
