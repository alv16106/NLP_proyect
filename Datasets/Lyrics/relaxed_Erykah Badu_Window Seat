So presently I'm standing
Here right now, you're so demanding
Tell me what you want from me
Concluding, concentrating
On my music, lover and my babies
Makes me wanna ask the lady
For a ticket outta town

So can I get a window seat
Don't want nobody next to me
I just want a ticket outta town
A look around and a safe touch down

Can I get a window seat
Don't want nobody next to me
I just want a chance to fly
A chance to cry and a long bye-bye
Oh, oh, oh
Oh

But I, I need you to want me
And I need you to miss me
I, I need your attention, yes
I need you next to me
Oh I, I need someone to clap for me
I need your direction

Somebody say
Come back, come back, baby, come back (I want you to need me)
Come back, come back, baby, come back (need me)
Come back, come back, baby, come back (I want you to need me)
Come back, come back, baby, come back

(So) Out my mind I'm tusslin'
Back and forth 'tween here and hustlin'
I don't wanna time travel no more
I wanna be here, my thinking

So on this porch I'm rockin'
Back and forth like Lightning Hopkins
If anybody speak to Scotty
Tell him, beam me up

So can I get a window seat
Don't want nobody next to me
I just want a ticket outta town
A look around and a safe touch down

Can I get a window seat
Don't want nobody next to me
See I just want a chance to fly
A chance to cry and a long bye-bye
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

But I, I need you to miss me
I need somebody come get me, ooh I
See, I need your attention, yes
And I need your energy, yes I do
Oh-oh, I need, I need someone to clap for me
I need your direction

Somebody say
Come back, come back, baby, come back (I want you to need me)
Come back, come back, baby, come back (I, oh yes, I, yes)
Come back, come back, baby, come back (come look for me)
Come back, come back, baby, come back (hey, yes, yes)

Can I get a window seat
Don't want nobody next to me
I just want a ticket outta town
A look around and a safe touch down
Oh, oh
Hey, I just need a chance to fly
A chance to cry and a long bye-bye
