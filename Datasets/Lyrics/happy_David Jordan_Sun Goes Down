Open your eyes 'cause another day is dawning,
Children of the moon, can you hear them all calling?
Skies open up and an angel starts falling,
Listen to their beats, can you hear them hollering?

Stop in the morning, through to the evening
Dance like you're the only one around
Move like you want it
Go move like you need it,
Dancing it up till the sun goes down

Free your mind 'cause tonight we're gonna break it down
Shake, make it funky down
Get so high as the toxins in your body
Are the bass and the drums and the roar, roar, roar
We're right on time, and all is fine
If you've lost your senses, here have mine and...

Lose yourself in the time
You will wait till the evening time
Till the sunshine breaks.

Ah... Come on!
Open your eyes 'cause another day is dawning,
Children of the moon, can you hear them all calling?
Skies open up and an angel starts falling,
Listen to their beats, can you hear them hollering?

Stop in the morning, through to the evening
Dance like you're the only one around
Move like you want it
Go move like you need it,
Dancing it up till the sun goes down.

Till the sun goes down

Go Come on for this makes for hysteria
You feelin' what we bring to y'all...
Peace and love guess I get it all tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight...

Fire is burning on and there's children in the forest playing
Just come forget this to forget the "?" hun the forests prey
Yeah no no ...yeah eey...

Till the sun goes down
Till the sun goes
Sun goes down
Sun goes down
Sun goes down, Sun goes down

Open your eyes 'cause another day is dawning,
Children of the moon, can you hear them all calling?
Skies open up and an angel starts falling,
Listen to their beats, can you hear them hollering?

Stop in the morning, through to the evening
Dance like you're the only one around
Move like you want it
Move like you need it,
Dancing it up till the sun goes down!
(Till Fade!)
