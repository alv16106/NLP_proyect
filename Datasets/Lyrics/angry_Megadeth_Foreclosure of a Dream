Rise so high, yet so far to fall
A plan of dignity and balance for all
Political breakthrough, euphoria's high
More borrowed money, more borrowed time
Backed in a corner, caught up in the race
A means to an end ended in disgrace
Perspective is lost in the spirit of the chase

Foreclosure of a dream
Those visions never seen
Until all is lost, personal holocaust
Foreclosure of a dream

Barren land that once filled the need
Are worthless now, dead without a deed
Slipping away from an iron grip
Nature's scales are forced to tip
The heartland dies, loss of all pride
To leave ain't believing, so try and be tried
Insufficient funds, insanity and suicide

Foreclosure of a dream
Those visions never seen
Until all is lost, personal holocaust
Foreclosure of a dream

"The congress will push me to raise taxes and I will say no. Read my lips..."

Now with new hope
Some will be proud
This is no hoax, no one pushed out
Receive a reprieve and be a pioneer
Break new ground of a new frontier
New ideas will surely get by
No deed or dividend, some may ask why
You'll find the solution, the answers in the sky

Rise so high, yet so far to fall
A plan of dignity and balance for all
Political breakthrough, euphoria's high
More borrowed money, more borrowed time

Foreclosure of a dream
Those visions never seen
Until all is lost, personal holocaust
Foreclosure of a dream

Foreclosure of a dream
Those visions never seen
Until all is lost, personal holocaust
Foreclosure of a dream

Holocaust
