Get up, get up, get up
You've got to keep on moving
Get up, get up, get up
You've got to keep on moving
Get up, get up, get up
You've got to keep on moving
Get up, get up, get up
You've got to keep on moving

If I could jump backwards, straight to the dance floor
Will you still be waiting for me? Will you still be my friend?
I don't wanna bug you
All these crazy, crazy ideas
For I know this ain't a good place for us to talk

You better get your move on
Or all the good ones will have gone
You better get your move on
Or all the good ones will have gone
You better get your move on

Get up, get up, get up
You've got to keep on moving
Get up, get up, get up
You've got to keep on moving
Get up, get up, get up
You've got to keep on moving
Get up, get up, get up
You've got to keep on moving

If you want to say goodbye, if you want to play seek-and-hide
Just stay, he'll got the time
Do you really need to be on time?
If there's something that you like, everybody's so so free outside
There's no need for playing nice, do you know what?

You better get your move on
Or all the good ones will have gone
You better get your move on
Or all the good ones will have gone
You better get your move on

Get up, get up, get up
You've got to keep on moving
Get up, get up, get up
You've got to keep on moving
Get up, get up, get up
You've got to keep on moving
Get up, get up, get up
You've got to keep on moving

All the stars are about to die, but you don't need to have insides
I don't want to change your life, so please hold me tight tonight
They could really use a cab, don't go out and crash your car
I don't mind being me yesterday
Just take me, kid

You better get your move on
Or all the good ones will have gone
You better get your move on
Or all the good ones will have gone
You better get your move on

Get up, get up, get up
You've got to keep on moving
Get up, get up, get up
You've got to keep on moving
Get up, get up, get up
You've got to keep on moving
Get up, get up, get up
You've got to keep on moving

If someone drops you on the floor and you don't know who did it
Just flick your hair and try to kick as many people as you can hit
You do what you gotta do, so please listen to me
Don't let no one play you a fool like they're a stinking {?} of you

You better get your move on
Or all the good ones will have gone
You better get your move on
Or all the good ones will have gone
You better get your move on
