We are young but we have heart
Born in this world as it all falls apart
We are strong but we don't belong
Born in this world as it all falls apart

I see the children in the rain
Like the parade before the pain
I see the love, I see the hate
I see this world that we can make
I see the life, I see the sky
I'd give it all to see you fly
Yes, we wave this flag of hatred
But you're the ones who made it

Watch the beauty of all our lives
Passing right before my eyes
I hear the hate in all your words
All the wars to make us hurt
We get so sick, oh, so sick
We never wanted all this
Medication for the kids
With no reason to live

So we march to the drums of the damned as we come
Watch it burn in the sun, we are numb

We are young but we have heart
Born in this world as it all falls apart
We are strong but we don't belong
Born in this world as it all falls apart

As we walk among these shadows
In these streets, these fields of battle
Take it up, we wear the medal
Raise your hands with burning candles
Hear us whisper in the dark
In the rain you see the spark
Feel the beating of our hearts
Fleeting hope as we depart

All together walk alone
Against all we've ever known
All we've ever really wanted
Was a place to call our home
But you take all we are
The innocence of our hearts
Made to kneel before the altar
As you tear us apart

So we march to the drums of the damned as we come
Watch it burn in the sun, we are numb

We are young but we have heart
Born in this world as it all falls apart
We are strong but we don't belong
Born in this world as it all falls apart

We will fight (We will fight)
Or we will fall (We will fall)
Till the angels save us all
We will fight (We will fight)
Or we will fall (We will fall)
Till the angels save us all

We will fight (We will fight)
Or we will fall (We will fall)
Till the angels save us all
We will fight (We will fight)
Or we will fall (We will fall)
Till the angels save us all

We are young but we have heart
Born in this world as it all falls apart
We are strong but we don't belong
Born in this world as it all falls apart

We are young but we have heart
Born in this world as it all falls apart
We are strong but we don't belong
Born in this world as it all falls apart
