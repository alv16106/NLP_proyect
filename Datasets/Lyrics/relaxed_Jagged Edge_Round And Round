Aight, so look (No)
I know you think everything I say (Yeah)
I jus' be talkin' (Oh)
It's alotta B.S, I know (We keep, we keep, we keep, we keep yeah, oh)
But we gotta stop goin' (Oh, we keep, we keep, we keep, we keep yeah)
Back and forth, back and forth
Up and down, up and down
Round, round, round and round
If it's up to me
I'll make it happen

Baby, we be goin' round, and round and round
It's time to lock you down (Time to lock you down)
And I'm givin' up them girls
On other sides of town
Only wantin' you to be around
Baby, we be goin' round, and round and round
It's time to settle down
Givin' up them girls
On other sides of town
And justify this love that I found
We be goin' round, and round and round

If a tornado swept through towns
We'd be goin' round and round
So many years that we stayed down
You sound like no other sound (No)
If I described my heart right now
Gotta turn my love side down
I'm on my knees, 'fronta of you right now
And I wanna make you mine

Where will this road lead us right now
Where we'll stop, nobody knows
We'll reach our pot of gold somehow
Just keep holdin' on
Like a merry-go-round
We keep, goin' round and round
We keep, we keep, goin' round and round
And I'm ready when you are, to let my game go

Baby, we be goin' round, and round and round
It's time to lock you down (Time to lock you down)
And I'm givin' up them girls
On other sides of town
Only wantin' you to be around (round, round, round)
Baby, we be goin' round, and round and round
Time to settle down (Time to settle down)
Givin' up them girls
On other sides of town


And justify this love that I found
We be goin' round, and round and round

It's like the spokes on an old 6-4
We be be goin' round and round
No one but you can hold this crown
So here's the plan girl
I'm tradin' in my J's for some flip-flops
I'm spendin' all my nights here with you
We so wrapped up in this beat, like it's hip-hop
I'm never gonna let you go

Where will this road lead us right now
Where we'll stop, nobody knows
We'll reach our pot of gold somehow
Just keep holdin' on
Like a merry-go-round
We keep, goin' round and round
We keep, we keep, goin' round and round
And I'm ready when you are, to let my game go

Baby, we be goin' round, and round and round
It's time to lock you down (Time to settle down)
And I'm givin' up them girls
On other sides of town
Only wantin' you to be around (Only wantin' you be around)
Baby, we be goin' round, and round and round
Time to settle down (Yeah)
Givin' up them girls
On other sides of town (All the sides of town)
And justify this love that I found
We be goin' round, and round and round

Breakdown:
Baby, the storm is over
Been through our worst together
Stoppin' us now, no ups and downs
We ain't goin' round and round, no more

Baby, we be goin' round, and round and round
It's time to lock you down (Time to lock you down)
And I'm givin' up them girls
On other sides of town (Baby yeah)
Only wantin' you to be around (Eh)
Baby, we be goin' round, and round and round
Time to settle down (I'm given you the love you deserve)
Givin' up them girls
On other sides of town
And justify this love that I found
We be goin' round, and round and round
Ooh...
