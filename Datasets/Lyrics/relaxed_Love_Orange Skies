Orange skies
Carnivals and cotton candy and you
And I love you too, you know I do

Nightingale
Prettier than anything in the world
And I love you too, you know I do

You, you make me happy
Laughing, glad, and full of glee
And you don't have to try, girl
For you it comes so naturally right here in my arms

Orange skies
Carnivals and cotton candy and you
And I love you too, you know I do

You make me happy
Laughing, glad, and full of glee
And you don't have to try, girl
For you it comes so naturally right here in my arms
