Everybody - it's a good thing
Everybody wants a good thing
Everybody - ain't it true that
Everybody's looking for the same thing

Ain't it true there's just no doubt
There's some things that you can do without and that's good
Ain't it true as the sun that shines
You got yours, and you got mine and that's good
Everybody's just like you - it's true
Everybody wants a good thing, too

Everybody - it's a good thing
Everybody wants a good thing
Everybody - ain't it true that
Everybody's looking for the same thing

Ain't it true there's room for doubt
Maybe some things that you can do without and that's good
Everybody's just like you - it's true
Everybody wants a good thing, too

Now let's have a great big hand for everybody that can understand
Life's a bee without a buzz - it's going great 'til you get stung
Now let's not forget to toast everyone who might've missed the boat
And to everybody else who waits 'til the next one sails in again

Everybody - it's a good thing
Ain't it true - it's a monumental good thing
Everybody - it's a good thing
Ain't it true - it's a monumental good thing
Everybody - it's a good thing
Ain't it true - it's a monumental good thing
