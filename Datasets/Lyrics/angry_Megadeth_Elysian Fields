Uneasy feeling, burning out my eyes
I hope the end is less painful than my life
I stand on trial before the gods on Judgment Day
A blink of an eye between the cradle and the grave

One last look at visions of flesh (ah-ah)
The last best hope of man on earth (ah-ah)
Pontius Pilate still washing his hands (ah-ah)
The world don't want to be saved, only left alone

(Elysian Fields) We are storming the heavens
(Elysian Fields) To raise the swords and shields
(Elysian Fields) We ascend to our destiny
(Elysian Fields) To the Elysian Fields

Soaring to the sun with blood upon their wings
Superstitious dust left twisting in the wind
Man still has one belief, one decree that stands alone
The laying down of arms is like cancer to their bones

One last look at visions of flesh (ah-ah)
The last best hope of man on earth (ah-ah)
Pontius Pilate still washing his hands (ah-ah)
The world don't want to be saved, only left alone

(Elysian Fields) We are storming the heavens
(Elysian Fields) To raise the swords and shields
(Elysian Fields) We ascend to our destiny
(Elysian Fields) To the Elysian Fields

(Elysian Fields) We are storming the heavens
(Elysian Fields) To raise the swords and shields
(Elysian Fields) We ascend to our destiny
(Elysian Fields) To the Elysian Fields
(Elysian Fields) (We are storming the heavens) We are storming the heavens
(Elysian Fields) (To raise the swords and shields) To raise the swords and shields
(Elysian Fields) (We ascend to our destiny) We ascend to our destiny
(Elysian Fields) To the Elysian Fields
