Locked inside this cage
Where all your world's a stage
And in this silent rage
Can you turn the page
Into something new
The fantasies
Of burden these gods kings and queens
Won't even dream of peace

If I could let these thoughts drown
And someday she might lose her crown
In time these chains that hold me down would set me free

No more screams or shouts
You're quiet as a mouse
And in this slaughterhouse
Is there no way out of here
They feed the fears and hide the grief
Of burden these gods (?) kings and queens
Won't even dream of peace

If I could let these thoughts drown
And someday he might lose his crown
In time these chains that hold me down would set me free
Would set me free

Don't look back and don't look down
You fall into the wishing well
Your frozen under someone's spell that keeps you running in and out ???
???

If I could let these thoughts drown
And someday she might lose her crown
In time these chains that hold me down would set me free

If I could let these thoughts drown
And someday he might lose his crown
In time these chains that hold me down would set me free
Would set me free
