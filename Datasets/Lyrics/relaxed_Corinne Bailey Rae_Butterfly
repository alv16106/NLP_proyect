In my mother's house there's a photograph,
Of a day gone past, always makes me laugh.
There's a little girl, wary of the world.
She's got much to learn, get her fingers burned.

An affinity between you and me, was a family. Yeah.
Said that I'd be fine, gave me all your time
And I left your side like a butterfly.

Shower me with your love, colour every day.
You make milkgold sun shine on me. Again.
Lift me up so high. And watch me fly away.
And you give me life like a butterfly.

In my mother's house there was happiness.
I wrapped myself in it, was my crysalis.
As my life unfolds, see a pattern through,
Of you protecting me, and I protecting you.

What was that you'd say?
"Make your own mistakes and when you're grown
Make sure that you remain the same."
Now I realise what was on your mind
When I left your side like a butterfly

Shower me with your love, colour every day.
You make milkgold sun shine on me. Yeah.
Lift me up so high. And watch me fly away.
And you give me life like a butterfly.

Shower me with your love, colour every day.
You make milkgold sun shine on me. Yeah.
Lift me up so high. And watch me fly away.
And you give me life like a butterfly.
