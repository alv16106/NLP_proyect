For so long I trailed you now here I am
But I can't stand with these jellybones

Checked myself into emergency, urgently
Drove up in my bone Camaro thinking only about you
The doctor walked her crew of surgeons to the table where I lay
When I came to, my kneecaps were off and they were soft, I had jellybones

I woke him up, broke the news, after everything was sewn
I said, "Son you've got a full blown case of what is known as jellybones"

Jelly, jelly, jelly, jelly
Jelly, jelly, jelly, jelly
Jelly, jellybones
Jelly, jelly, jelly, jelly
Jelly, jelly, jelly, jelly
Jelly, jellybones

But this is love so we'll survive
This is love so we'll survive
But this is love so we'll survive
This is love so we'll survive
This is love so we'll survive
This is love so we'll survive
This is love so we'll survive
