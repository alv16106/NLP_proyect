We're the people, the lucky with the fragile bones
The ones who sit and worry about getting too old
We're the people, the happy with the broken hearts
The ones who draw a picture and proclaim that it's art

But you, and you, and you and you
You're just a animal developed into
You, and you, and you, and you
A monkey needs to dance, so do you

We're the people, the lucky with the fragile bones
The ones who sit and worry about catching a cold
We're the people, the happy with the broken hearts
The ones who draw a picture and proclaim that it's art

But you, and you, and you and you
You're just a animal developed into
You, and you, and you, and you
A monkey needs to dance, so do you

You like to do it as a child on your own
You're in the jungle and the monkeys
Take your mind from your home
How many times do they have to tell you
That it's perfectly fine for you to dance around
Naked when you're all by yourself

Cause' you, and you, and you, and you
You're just a animal developed into
You, and you, and you, and you
A monkey needs to dance, so do you

We're the people, the lucky with the fragile bones
The ones who sit and worry about getting to old
You're the monkey in the jungle trying to find your place
The one who let the sunset bring a silly kind of smile on your face

But you, and you, and you, and you
You're just a animal developed into
You, and you, and you, and you
A monkey needs to dance, so do you

You like to do it as a child on your own
You're in the jungle and the monkeys
Take your mind from your home
How many times do they have to tell you
That it's perfectly fine for you to dance around
Naked when you're all by yourself

Cause you, and you, and you, and you
You're just a animal developed into
You, and you, and you, and you
A monkey needs to dance, so do you

A monkey needs to dance, so do you
