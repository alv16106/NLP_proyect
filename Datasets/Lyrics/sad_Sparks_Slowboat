Slowboat takes me to your home everyday
And I wait for you knowing that you won't
Come home, just today
For you've found someone new and you'll bid me adieu
And I leave you now, but I'll come back another day

Ooh, sail me far away
Slowboat, bring me back another day
Ooh, sail me far away

Slowboat sail off toward the seventh sea
Far away from you, but somehow coming
Close again and again
And again as we near from some sign it appears
That you won't come home, you won't come home just today

Ooh, sail me far away
Slowboat, bring me back another day

Slowboat takes me where I'll always be
Far away from you, but knowing that you
Won't come near me but you hear me
And you'll always be a true love to me
Though you're never home, I'll come back another day

Ooh, sail me far away
Slowboat, bring me back another day
