Miss Liberty turn inna Jezzabelle
All de dreams you go sell, de whole dem turn inna hell
Her bed of roses are filled with thorns
Her righteous robes are tattered and torn

If she had only stood for love
That would have been enough
She wouldn't have to hide her shame
If she had only stood for love
That would have been enough
But now she's burnt us all with her flames

Amerimacka
Oh what a beautiful life
Amerimacka
Is like licking honey off a knife

Amerimacka
Oh what a beautiful sight
Amerimacka
Oh what a beautiful life

The land of the free built on slavery
Our consciousness in captivity
The promise land is the liar's den
Your culture of greed has got to end

Now we're laying in the mud
Looking up above
Tear water just ah drop from the sky
They try to keep us in the mud
Separating us from love
But me nah go let dem conquer de I

Amerimacka
Oh what a beautiful life
Amerimacka
Is like licking honey off a knife

Amerimacka
Oh what a beautiful sight
Amerimacka
Oh what a beautiful life
