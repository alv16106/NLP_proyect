You pretty women
Stand in line
Make love to you baby
In an hour's time
Now I'm a man
I spell M-A-N

The line I shoot
Will never miss
Make love to you baby
You can't resist
Now I'm a man
I spell M-A-N... man

Going back down
To Kansas too
Bring back a little girl
Just like you
Now I'm a man
I spell M-A-N... man
