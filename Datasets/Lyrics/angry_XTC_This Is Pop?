In a milk bar and feeling lost
Drinking sodas as cold as frost
Someone leans in my direction
Quizzing on my juke-box selection
What do you call that noise
That you put on?

This is pop
Yeah Yeah
This is pop
Yeah Yeah
This is pop
Yeah Yeah
This is!

On a walkway and moving fast
All I get is transistor blast
Someone leans in in my direction
Quizzing on my station selection
What do you call that noise
That you put on?

This is pop
Yeah yeah
This is pop
Yeah Yeah
This is pop
Yeah Yeah
This is!

We come the wrong way
We come the long way
We play the songs much too loud

This is pop
Yeah yeah 
This is pop
Yeah Yeah
This is pop
Yeah Yeah
This is!

This is pop
Yeah Yeah
This is pop
Yeah Yeah
This is pop
Yeah Yeah
This is!

This is pop
Yeah Yeah
This is pop
Yeah Yeah
This is pop
Yeah Yeah
This is!

Pop!
