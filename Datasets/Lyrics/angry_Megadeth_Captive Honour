Madness comes, and madness goes
An insane place, with insane moves
Battles without, for battles within
Where evil lives and evil rules
Breaking them up, just breaking them in
Quickest way out, quickest relief wins
Never disclose, never betray
Cease to speak or cease to breathe
And when you kill a man, you're a murderer
Kill many, and you're a conqueror
Kill them all... ooh... oh, you're a god!

- Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
Have you reached a verdict?
- Yes, we have, Your Honour
We find the defendant guilty, on all counts
For crimes against all humanity!
- By virtue of the jury's decision
And the power vested in me by the State
I hereby sentence you to be incarcerated with no possibility of parole
For life
- Life?... Whadda ya mean, life?
I ain't got a life!
- Boy!... Your soul better belong to Jesus!
Hmmm-mmm, 'cause your ass belongs to me!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

Captive honour, ain't no honour
Captive honour, ain't no honour

No time for questions
No time for games
Start kicking ass
And taking down the names
A long shit list
A shorter fuse
He is untouchable
And guarantees you'll lose

Captive honour, ain't no honour
Captive honour, ain't no honour

Inside the big house
His nightmare unfolds
Before he got there
His man-pussy was sold
Black blanket welcome
This tough guy's now a bitch
Praying for death
It can't be worse than this

Captive honour, ain't no honour
Captive honour, ain't no honour

Captive honour, ain't no honour
