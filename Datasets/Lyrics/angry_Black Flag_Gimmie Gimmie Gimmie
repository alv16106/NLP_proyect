Gimme, gimme, gimme
I need some more
Gimme, gimme, gimme
Don't ask what for
One, two, three, four

Standing here like a loaded gun, waiting to go off
I've got nothing to do but shoot my mouth off

Gimme, gimme, gimme
I need some more
Gimme, gimme, gimme
Don't ask what for

I'm gonna go out, get something for my head
If I keep on doing this, I'm gonna end up dead

So gimme, gimme, gimme
I need some more
Gimme, gimme, gimme
Don't ask what for

I know the world's got problems, I've got problems of my own
Not the kind that can't be solved with an atom bomb

So gimme, gimme, gimme
I need some more
Gimme, gimme, gimme
Don't ask what for

Gimme, gimme, gimme
I need some more
Gimme, gimme, gimme
Don't ask what for
One, two, three, four

Standing here like a loaded gun, waiting to go off
I've got nothing to do but shoot my mouth off

So gimme, gimme, gimme
I need some more
Gimme, gimme, gimme
Don't ask what for
