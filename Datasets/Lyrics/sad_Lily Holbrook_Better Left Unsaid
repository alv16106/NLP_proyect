I can't cut my heart in sections and I'll show you no objection
'Cause it's better than being alone, it's better than being alone
And there's a...
A strange elation, in your shadow, assassination
I thought I saw a glimmer of hope, I thought I saw a glimmer of hope

But I don't think that you could ever understand
...Everyone keeps falling down
I don't think that you could ever understand
...Everyone keeps falling down
I don't think that you could ever understand
...Everyone keeps falling down
I don't think that you could ever understand
...Everyone keeps falling down

I could stay here in the middle
And speak to you in riddles
But I'd rather just feel the burn
I'd rather feel the burn so you can
Strike me with your matches
And scatter me like ashes...
Your little angel playing in your dirt...

But I don't think that you could ever understand
...Everyone keeps falling down
I don't think that you could ever understand
...Everyone keeps falling down
I don't think that you could ever understand
...Everyone keeps falling down
I don't think that you could ever understand
...Everyone keeps falling down

Some things I keep to myself
Some things are better left unsaid
Sometimes I feel like this could burden me and i
And some things I'll never ever tell

'Cause I don't think that you could ever understand
...Everyone keeps falling down
I don't think that you could ever understand
...Everyone keeps falling down
'Cause I don't think that you could ever understand
...Everyone keeps falling down (and I will let you chain me down for a while...)
I don't think that you could ever understand
...Everyone keeps falling down (and I will let you wear my crown for a while...)
I don't think that you could ever understand
...Everyone keeps falling down
'Cause I don't think that you could ever understand
...Everyone keeps falling down (and I will let you chain me down for a while...)
I don't think that you could ever understand
...Everyone keeps falling down (and I will let you wear my crown for a while...)
...For a while...
