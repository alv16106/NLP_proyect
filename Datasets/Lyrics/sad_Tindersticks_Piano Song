Shut up, I'm thinking
Shut up, I'm thinking
Shut up, I'm thinking
I'm thinking, so shut up

If I hold you too tight, just say "let go"
I know this touch can leave you hurting
When my words clatter about your head
Don't go to bed, just say "shut up"

'Cause in my sleep I still clench my teeth
I'm at my strongest only when I'm weak
And give you those bruises just by talking to you
You know I can laugh 'til you're almost through

Shut up, yeah
Shut up, yeah
Shut up, yeah
I'm thinking, oh

Shut up, yeah
Shut up, yeah
Shut up, yeah
I'm thinking, oh
