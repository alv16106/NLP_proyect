Once I had a love and it was a gas
Soon turned out had a heart of glass
Seemed like the real thing, only to find
Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind

Once I had a love and it was divine
Soon found out I was losin' my mind
Seemed like the real thing, but I was so blind
Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind

In between
What I find is pleasin'
And I'm feelin' fine
Love is so confusing,
There's no peace of mind
If I fear I'm losin' you
It's just not good
You teasin' like you do

Once I had a love and it was a gas
Soon turned out had a heart of glass
Seemed like the real thing, my life is so fine
Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind

Lost inside
Adorable illusion
And I cannot hide
I'm the one you're usin'
Please don't push me aside
We could've made it cruisin', yeah

Yeah, ridin' high
On love's true bluish light

Once I had a love and it was a gas
Soon turned out had a heart of glass
Seemed like the real thing, only to find
Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind

In between
What I find is pleasin'
And I'm feelin' fine
Love is so confusing
There's no peace of mind
If I fear I'm losin' you
It's just not good
You teasin' like you do
