Go west
Paradise is there
You'll have all that you can eat
Of milk and honey over there

You'll be the brightest star
The world has ever seen
Sun-baked slender heroine
Of film and magazine

So, go west
Paradise is there
You'll have all that you can eat
Of milk and honey over there

You'll be the brightest light
The world has ever seen
The dizzy height of the jet-set life
You could never dream

Your pale blue eyes
Strawberry hair
Lips so sweet
Skin so fair

Your future bright
Beyond compare
It's rags to riches
Over there

San Andreas Fault
Moved its fingers
Through the ground
Earth divided
Plates collided
Such an awful sound

San Andreas Fault
Moved its fingers
Through the ground
Terra cotta shattered
And the walls came
Tumbling down

Oh, promised land  (Oh, promised land)
Oh, wicked ground  (Wicked ground)
Build a dream
Tear it down

Oh, promised land  (Oh, promised land)
What a wicked ground  (What a wicked ground)
Build a dream
Watch it all fall down
