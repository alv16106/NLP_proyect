Like a long lonely stream
I keep running towards a dream
Moving on (moving on)
Moving on (moving on)

Like a branch on a tree
I keep reaching to be free
Moving on (moving on)
Moving on (moving on)

(Cause) There's a place in the sun
Where there's hope for everyone
Where my poor restless heart's gotta run
There's a place in the sun
And before my life is done
Gotta find me a place in the sun

Like an old dusty road
I get weary from the load
Moving on (moving on)
Moving on (moving on)

Like this tired troubled earth
I've been rolling since my birth
Moving on (moving on)
Moving on (moving on)

(Cause) There's a place in the sun
Where there's hope for everyone
Where my poor restless heart's gotta run
I know there's a place in the sun
And before my life is done
Gotta find me a place in the sun

You know, when times are bad
And you're feeling sad
I want you to always remember

Yes, there's a place in the sun
(Place in the sun, place in the sun)
Where there's hope for everyone
(Hope for everyone, hope for everyone)
Where my poor restless heart's gotta run
(Poor restless heart, poor restless heart)
I know there's a place in the sun
(Place in the sun, place in the sun)
