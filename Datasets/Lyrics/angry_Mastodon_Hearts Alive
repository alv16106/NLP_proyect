Taken down with hearts alive
Our hearts alive

Lurking dark underground
Descend to the bottom
Swim below eternally
Into the deep blue sea

Time and space, all alone
It can be a lonely place
There it goes, opening up
I can't stand, I can't breathe

Rolled fin out
Oil stripped
Hole is filled

Ocean coil, water boils
He swims to the surface
Flame from mouth, smoke he breathes
Enter the caverns of the deep

Time and space, all alone
It can be a lonely place
There it goes, opening up
I can't stand, I can't breathe

Terrified
Ghastly cry
Spiraled lives
Taken down
Taken down

The iron side
Bucket of lead
Battle is she
Not for defeat
The iron side
Bucket of lead
Battle is she
