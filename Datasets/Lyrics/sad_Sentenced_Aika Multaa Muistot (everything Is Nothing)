Everything is nothing to me, I couldn't care less
A stern cold man is what I am, hard, relentless
And thought I might have strayed the path I wouldn't change a thing
I've hated life to the fullest yet with longing deep within

For my name is sorrow and I'm a friend of misery
I deprived myself of love for eternal agony
And I don't even dare to try - I know I can only lose
Between this life I live and nothing I have to choose

Take me home...
...To the one I belong
Hey!

I'll see you all go down and witness your demise
I'll be the last to close, the last to close my eyes
And forgive me nothing for I truly meant it all
- What I've said, what I've done
