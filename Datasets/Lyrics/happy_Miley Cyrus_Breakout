Every week's the same
Stuck in school, so lame
My parents say that I'm lazy
Gettin' up at 8 A.M.'s crazy
Tired of being told what to do
So unfair, so uncool

The day’s too long
And I'm holding on
'Til I hear the bell ring
'Cause that’s the time when we're gonna, time when we're gonna

Breakout,
Let the party start,
We're gonna stay out,
Gonna break some hearts,
We're gonna dance 'til the dance floor falls apart,
Uh-oh! All over again,
We're gonna wake up,
Everyone we know,
We're gonna have some fun, gonna lose control,
It feels so good, to let go-oh-oh (Go-oh-oh)

Hanging out’s just something we like to do
My friends and the mess we get into,
These are the lessons that we choose
Not a book full of things we'll never use

The day's too long
And I'm holding on
'Til I hear the bell ring
'Cause that’s the time when we’re gonna, time when we're gonna

Breakout,
Let the party start,
We're gonna stay out,
Gonna break some hearts,
We're gonna dance 'til the dance floor falls apart,
Uh-oh! All over again,
We're gonna wake up,
Everyone we know,
We're gonna have some fun, gonna lose control,
It feels so good, to let go-oh-oh (go-oh-oh)

Wish it would never end
Spending time with my friends
Oh, with my friends

Breakout,
Let the party start,
We're gonna stay out,
Gonna break some hearts,
We're gonna dance 'til the dance floor falls apart,
Uh-oh! All over again,
We're gonna wake up,
Everyone we know,
We're gonna have some fun, gonna lose control,
It feels so good, to let go
