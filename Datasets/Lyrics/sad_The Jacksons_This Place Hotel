Live in sin
Ten years ago on this day my heart churned
I promised I would never ever be returning
Where my baby broke my heart and left me yearning, hoo, ooh

As we walked into the room
There were faces staring, glaring, tearing through me, uh
Someone said, "Welcome to the doom"
Then they smiled with eyes that looked as if they knew me
This is scaring me

We walked up the stairs still concealing gloom
There were two girls sitting in my room
She walked up to my face, said, "This is the place
You said, 'Meet you right here at noon'" (ooh)

This is Heartbreak Hotel
Welcome to Heartbreak Hotel
So this is Heartbreak Hotel
This place is Heartbreak Hotel

Hope is dead, uh
She thought that I had cheated for another lover, uh
I turn my back to see that I am undercover, uh
Now I can't convince this girl there ain't no other, hoo, ooh

Someone's evil to hurt my soul
Every smile's a trial thought in beguile to hurt me
This is scaring me
Then the man next door had told
He's been here in tears for fifteen years
This is scaring me

We came to this place where the vicious dwell
Found that wicked women run this strange hotel
There was Sefra and Sue, every girl that I knew
And my baby said, "Love is through" (ooh)

This is Heartbreak Hotel
Welcome to Heartbreak Hotel
So evil, Heartbreak Hotel
This place is Heartbreak Hotel

Someone stabbed my heart (Heartbreak Hotel)

Ten years ago today (Heartbreak Hotel)

Someone stabbed my heart (Heartbreak Hotel) uh

Ten years ago today (Heartbreak Hotel) uh
Hurting my mind (Heartbreak Hotel) hoo

This is Heartbreak Hotel (Heartbreak Hotel)
Just welcome to the scene, hoo
