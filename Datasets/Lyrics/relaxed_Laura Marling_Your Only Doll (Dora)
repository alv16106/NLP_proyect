I fell into the street, poison in my veins
Clambered to my feet and into the night again
Back to my home, back to my owner
Who screams at my tardiness
Put his hands to the sky

And says, what can I do with a girl 
If she refuses to be mine?

In his bed I am queen, unobtainable me
Sexual being, human with feelings
The two are not me
The two will not be mine.

And what can you do with a girl,
If she refuses to be mine?

Put his hand on my shirt
Hand on my face,
Head to the wall
When you've broken your only doll

And what will you do with a girl
If she refuses to be alive?

And you've broken your only doll
And what will you do with a girl
If she's refusing to be alive?
