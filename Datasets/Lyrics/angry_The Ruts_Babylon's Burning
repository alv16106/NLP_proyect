Babylon's burning, you'll burn in the street
You'll burn in your houses, with anxiety

With anxiety, Babylon's burning, Babylon's burning
With anxiety, Babylon's burning, Babylon's burning

Babylon's burning, you'll burn in the street
You'll burn in the ghetto, with anxiety

With anxiety, Babylon's burning, Babylon's burning
With anxiety, Babylon's burning, Babylon's burning
Babylon's burning baby, can't you see?
Babylon is burning with anxiety

You'll burn at your work, you'll burn at your play,
This monster is smouldering, with ignorance and hate

And with anxiety etc

Babylon's burning, Baylon's burning
Babylon is burning
Babylon's burning, Babylon's burning
Babylon is burning
