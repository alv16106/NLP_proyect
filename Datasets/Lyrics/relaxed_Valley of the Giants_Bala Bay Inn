The Bala Bay Inn
Was built in 1910
Not much has changed in this hotel

People still come by
To dance, dine, and sing
And remember Louis Riel

Row boats on the water
Wave to the train
Passing by

Steamships and trains
Will never stop here again
But I hope that I will
Sometime

Row boats on the water
Wave to the trains
Passing by

Steamships and trains
May never stop here again
But I hope that I do
Sometime

If you're smokin' that shit
You'd better get your mind right

If you're smokin' that shit
You better get your mind right

If you're smokin' that shit
You better get your mind right

If you're smokin' that shit
You better get your mind right

If you're smokin' that shit
You better get your mind right

If you're smokin' that shit
You better get your mind right

If you're smokin' that shit
You better get your mind right

If you're smokin' that shit
You better get your mind right

If you're smokin' that shit
You better get your mind right

(That was fine, no? how many times do want to record this?)
