Ooh, oh yeah
Ooh, oh yeah
Ooh, oh yeah

You insult me in my home you're forgiven this time
Things go well you're eyes dilate you shake and I'm high
Look in my eyes deep and watch the clouds change with time
Twenty hours won't print my picture milk carton size

Carton size
Carton size
Carton size

Call me up congratulations ain't the real why
There's no pressures besides brilliance let's say by day nine
Endless corporate ignorance lets me control time
By the way (by the way, by the way, by the way)

Once again you see an in
Discolored skin gives you away
So afraid you kindly gurgle
Out a date, for me

Ooh, oh yeah
Ooh, oh yeah
Ooh, oh yeah

Now the body of one soul I adore wants to die
You have always told me you'd not live past twenty-five

I say stay long enough to repay all who caused strife

Once again you see an in
Discolored skin gives you away
So afraid you kindly gurgle
Out a date, for me

Once again you see an in
Discolored skin gives you away
So afraid you kindly gurgle
Out a date, for me

Ooh, oh yeah
Ooh

Spoken:
I bear true and an existing witness to this barrel of monkeys. A self-proclaimed immoral success, perfected by each whereof; individually deadly, and equally so and spread about the surrendered troops, for even thousands of miles cannot tear apart their communication, or the lack thereof. Vultures, liars, thieves: each proclaim their innocence in no suggestion or rhyme, your weapon is contained in the wrecking of keeping the desired effect. The breaking of the spirit thwarts the whole being.

Your weapon is guilt
Your weapon is guilt
Your weapon is guilt
Guilt
