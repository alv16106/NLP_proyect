Enter the arena and hit the lights
Step up now, you're in for a ride
This is war, ain't no fun and games
We'll get it up, you'll go down in flames

Party time, going down
You'd better not mess us around
The stakes are rich, take a hit or stay
The price is high, someone's gonna pay

Heads I win, tails you lose
Out of my way I'm coming through
Roll the dice don't think twice
And we crush (crush), crush 'em (crush 'em)

Looking for trouble, now you've found it
You're a drum and we're gonna pound it
Last one standing wins the fight
Hear us scream and shout all night
Down on the floor and eat the grit
This is gonna hurt a little bit

Heads I win, tails you lose
Out of my way, I'm coming through
Roll the dice, don't think twice
And we crush (crush), crush 'em (crush 'em)

Now we lay you down to rest
You'll never be more than second best
Step inside, you're in for a ride
And we crush (crush), crush 'em (crush 'em)

Crush, crush, crush...

Don't need reason, (crush) don't want names
Just a John Doe (crush) to put to shame
Step aside (crush), let me explain
The name of the game is pain (crush 'em)

Now we've found you (crush), we're gonna pound you
We're gonna beat you (crush), gonna defeat you
We're gonna bust you (crush), we're gonna crush you
We're gonna crush'em

Heads I win, tails you lose
Out of my way, I'm coming through
Roll the dice, don't think twice
And we crush (crush), crush 'em (crush 'em)

Now we lay you down to rest
You'll never, never be more than second best
Step inside, you're in for a ride
And we crush (crush), crush 'em (crush 'em)

Crush, crush, crush, crush 'em
Crush, crush, crush, crush 'em

(Don't wait) Crush (hitting 'em all), crush
(Take some time) Crush (to crush 'em), crush 'em
(Better than you) Crush (just some tears), crush
(It's gonna hurt) Crush (crush 'em), crush 'em
(Now, here) Crush (hit the night), crush
(It's going down) Crush (I'm gonna crush 'em), crush 'em
(Crush) Crush (crush), crush (crush), crush (crush 'em), crush 'em
(Crush) Crush (crush), crush (crush), crush (crush 'em), crush 'em
