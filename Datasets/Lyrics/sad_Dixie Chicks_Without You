I've sure enjoyed the rain,
But I'm looking forward to the sun.
You have to feel the pain,
When you lose the love you gave someone.
I thought by now that time,
Would take away these lonely tears.
I hope you're doing fine all alone,
But where do I go from here? 'cause

Without you I'm not okay,
And without you I've lost my way.
My heart's stuck in second place,
Ooh, Without you.

Well I never thought I'd be
Lying here without you by my side.
It seems unreal to me,
That the life you promised was a lie.
You made it look so easy,
Making love into memories.
I guess you got what you wanted,
But what about me? 'cause

Without you I'm not okay,
And without you I've lost my way.
My heart's stuck in second place.
Ooh, Without you.

Somebody tell my head to try to tell my heart,
That I'm better off without you.
'Cause baby I can't live,

Without you I'm not okay,
And without you I've lost my way.
My heart's stuck in second place,
Ooh,
Without you
Without you
