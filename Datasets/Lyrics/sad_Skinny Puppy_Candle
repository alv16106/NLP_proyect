Here falls now undone
Looks beyond the credits sum
Livid fractures less of fate
The whisper winds blow the seeds of hate

Disturbed society
Dogs might turn with no values
Intend to raise ability
A tried and tested pointless view
God's got security
Hands like snakes sow the seeds

Raise all negative force-fed
Traces poisons all impure
Profane the haunted heaven
Jeering leapt into the pit of calamity
A mean condition no wealth dents
Provisions for a time unknown
Thelemic gestures are planned and hatched
In seasons of dissolute pain

I cried afflicted and infected
Oblige the system's perfect dream
Distorted my words
Assume all that is programmed before me
And somewhat left unsaid behind shutters

Dirt before desire
Dusted crap ingested comes
Stealing life that you are not visited
Warped torpedo night crawls through
The distant and irrelevant
A good life's experiment fused

I'm laying violent hands upon
A dead card calling cattle
The playthings are so abused
The derelict dial phone clock pusher
Delved in reliving the future too

I'm sticking pins and needles
In this stinging rotten flesh-like substitute
Pieces of half cooked meat that are
Walking on this earth
Abort desire irrelevance ticks in front in view
Ticks in front of you
Ticks in front in view

A candle rhyme to realign
Burnt out shadows on the wall seize the moment
Reach!
