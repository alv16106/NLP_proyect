So god damn easy to write this
You make it spill on the page.
So drunk on yourself, self-righteous
The laughing stock of your own fuckin' stage.

But I ain't one to call names
Or throw stones in a house of glass
You try me.

This is a muthafuckin' invitation
The only one you could ever need
This is a muthafuckin' invitation
You try me.

Just one time, you got a reason
Heard you had nothin' to lose
A blind preacher for the pin-eyed congregation
It must be easy to lose.

But I ain't one to call names
Or throw stones in a house of glass
You try me.

This is a muthafuckin' invitation
The only one you could ever need
This is a muthafuckin' invitation
You try me.

You can tell the same lie a thousand times
But it never gets any more true
So close your eyes once more & once more believe
That they all still believe in you.

Just one time.

This is a muthafuckin' invitation
The only one you could ever need
This is a muthafuckin' invitation
Just one time.

This is a muthafuckin' invitation
You try me.

Just one time.
You try me.
Just one time.
You try me.
You try me.
