I can take the rain on the roof of this empty house
That don't bother me
I can take a few tears now and then and just let them out
I'm not afraid to cry

Every once in a while even though goin' on with you gone
Still upsets me
There are days every now and again I pretend I'm okay
But that's not what gets me

What hurts the most was being so close
And having so much to say (Much to say)
And watchin' you walk away (Walk away)

Never knowing what could have been
And not seein' that lovin' you
Is what I was tryin' to do

It's hard to deal with the pain of losing you everywhere I go
But I'm doin' it
It's hard to force that smile when I see our old friends and I'm alone

Still harder gettin' up, gettin' dressed, livin' with this regret
But I know if I could do it over
I would trade, give away all the words that I saved in my heart
That I left unspoken

What hurts the most was being so close
And having so much to say (Much to say)
And watchin' you walk away (Walk away)

Never knowing what could have been
And not seein' that lovin' you
Is what I was tryin' to do

Oho!
Heyey!

I'm not afraid to cry every once in a while even though goin' on with you gone
Still upsets me
There are days every now and again I pretend I'm okay
But that's not what gets me

What hurts the most was being so close
And having so much to say (Much to say)
And watchin' you walk away (Walk away)

Never knowing what could have been
And not seein' that lovin' you
Is what I was tryin' to do

What hurts the most was being so close
And having so much to say (Much to say)
And watchin' you walk away (Walk away)

Never knowing what could have been
And not seein' that lovin' you
Is what I was tryin' to do
