So if we all come together, we all want to do
We all come together, just to sing we love you
And if we all come together, we all want to do
We all come together just for you

Racing all around the seven seas
Chasing all the girls and making robberies
Causing panic everywhere they go
Party-hardy on Titanic

Sailing, sailing, jumping off the railing
Drinking, drinking, till the ship is sinking
Gambling, stealing, lots of sex appealing
Come, let us sing the sailor song

So if we all come together, we all want to do
We all come together, just to sing we love you
And if we all come together, we all want to do
We all come together just for you

Sailorman, you really turn me on (Ar!)
Now the guys are gone, come let us get it on
Girls like me are pretty hard to find
So if you go, I'll kick your Heine

Sailing, sailing, jumping off the railing
Drinking, drinking, till the ship is sinking
Gambling, stealing, lots of sex appealing
Come, let us sing the sailor song

So if we all come together, we all want to do
We all come together, just to sing we love you
And if we all come together, we all want to do
We all come together just for you

Now, let's fight!
Ha, that's not a knife! This is a knife!

(Ay! Ow! Ooh!)

Sailing, sailing, jumping off the railing
Drinking, drinking, till the ship is sinking
Gambling, stealing, lots of sex appealing
Come, let us sing the sailor song

So if we all come together, we all want to do
We all come together, just to sing we love you
And if we all come together, we all want to do
We all come together just for you

Oh yeah! Ow!

I'm king of the world! Woo-hoo!

Wow, this was great!
Yeah, baby, you can sail my ship!

So if we all come together, we all want to do
We all come together just for you

Yeah!
