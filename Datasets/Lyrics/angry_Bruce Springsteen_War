If you grew up in the 60's
You grew up with war on TV every night
A war that your friends were involved in

And I want to do this song tonight for all the young people out there
If you're in your teens
Because I remember a lot of my friends when they we were 17 or 18
We didn't have much of a chance to think about how we felt about a lot of things

And the next time they're gonna be looking at you
And you're gonna need a lot of information to know what you're gonna wanna do
Because in 1985, blind faith in your leaders, or in anything, will get you killed
'Cause what I'm talking about here is

War (Ooh!), ooh, yeaheaheaheah
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing!
Say it again

War (Ooh!), ooh, yeaheaheaheah
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing!
Come on!

War is something that I despise
For it means destruction of innocent lives
And thousands of mothers and their mothers cry
When their sons go out to fight to give their lives

War (Ooh!), ohoho, yeah
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing!
Say it again

War (Ooh!), ohoho, yeah
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing!
Hey!

War (Ooh!), it's nothing but a heartbreaker
War (Ooh!), friend only to the undertaker

Yeah, the war is the enemy of all mankind
The thought of War (Ooh!), it blows my mind
Handed down from generation to generation
Induction, destruction, who wants to die?

War (Ooh!), ohoho now
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing!
Say it again

War (Ooh!), yeaheaheaheah
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing!
Come on, man

War (Ooh!), it ain't nothing but a heartbreaker
War (Ooh!), friend only to the undertaker

War has shattered many young men's dreams
Made them disabled, bitter and mean
Life is too precious to be fighting wars each day
War can't give life, it can only take it away

War (Ooh!), ohoho, yeah
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing!
Say it again

War (Ooh!), good god
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing!

Peace love and understanding, god
There must be some place for these things today
They say we must fight to keep our freedom
But, Lord, there's gotta be another way that's better than

War (Ooh!), yeaheaheaheah
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing!
Say it again!

War (Ooh!), good god
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing!
Come on now!

War (Ooh!), yeaheaheaheah
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing!
Say it again!

War (Ooh!), oh yeah
What is it good for?
Nothing!

I'm talking 'bout war!
