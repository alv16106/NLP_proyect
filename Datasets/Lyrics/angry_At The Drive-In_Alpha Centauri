Widows, an antique replacement
A briefcase filled with mace
Widows, six legged lost and found, found
Students, spray the Kent State mace
Wishing wells, missing clientele
Widows, six legged lost and found, found

Parkas worn in summer apparel
Sweat lodge comatose of broken arrows

Widows, veiled in rebound sheets
This is the ghost of a chance the lonely
Widows, six legged lost and found, found
Precision, watch the scalpel make roads
Hear them talk in paranoid parables
Widows, six legged lost and found, found

Storefront chairman's fingering button
This running of the bulls will trample all the life support system

Gored my neck, don't spare me death
I'm running circles
Red cape paper, taste the vapor
