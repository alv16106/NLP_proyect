I take it anywhere, any time that I can
I am the fucking son of a superman
I got a weapon that's as deadly as life
It's a well trained tool a master guy
Every day it's the same, regime
A dozen girls are on my scene
Say sex boy will you come
Into my hand
They're all on the floor
I better do what I can
Take a number, it's supply and demand
Anytime that I can
I'm the fucking son of a superman
I got a weapon that's as deadly as life
It's a well trained tool a master guy
I put my knife into your gut
You gotta be above when your above
Wanna make love
Say it exactly, sex boy, such
A sideshow poster
After such a sweet sweet slut
Any time that I can
I'm the fucking son of a superman
I know what it takes
What in the time that I can and can't do
I know what it takes to satisfy you
I know what it takes
That's why your time is due
In the house of fortune
I take it out and you know it's gonna
Come from behind
Just like you, and you, and you
And you
