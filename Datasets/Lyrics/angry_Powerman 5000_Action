The sky is falling
It's a curious condition,
It ain't a fallacy
It ain't superstition,
You live your life
Like you're some kind of actor,
But this scenario
You cannot manufacture

We're gonna need some action!
We're gonna need some action soon!
Trapped in a world of ordinary madness
It's all the same, yeah, there's nothing new

Where'd you learn how
To be so complacent?
They beat you down
And you might as well face it,
Your heroes lied, yeah,
They're all just a fake,
Don't know how much more
Of this I can take

We're gonna need some action! 
We're gonna need some action soon!
Trapped in a world of ordinary madness 
It's all the same and there's nothing new
