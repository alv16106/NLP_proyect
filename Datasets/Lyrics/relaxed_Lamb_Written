The wind stands still around you
And suddenly I'm trembling and I don't know why
There's something deep about you
That echoes in my mind

Mystifying feelings
Running round in my brain
Love is all around me
And it's written in your name
Love is all around me
And it's written in your name

The wind stands still around you
And in your eyes the light inside you shines
If souls collide in heaven
Why not in present time?

Words just can't convey it
Silence means no need to explain
Love is all around me
And it's written in your name
Love is all around me
And it's written in your name

I am overcome
What a strange thing you have done
From now on my life has change
Nothing now can be the same

Love is all around me
Love is all around me
And it's written in your name
Love is all around me
And it's written in your name
