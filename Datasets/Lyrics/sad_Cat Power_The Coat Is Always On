Mother don't sit
Mother don't stand
Mother don't send me

Sister come and lay your head on me,
I can see you haven't had any sleep in a long time

That baby's gonna be so easy on me,
Never see his smile
Never see his face

Father said he was gonna give me something,
He gave me hate

Mother don't sit
Mother don't stand
Mother don't send me

Brother can't even speak,
He's got a tongue and two legs to walk on,
And he can't leave
Brother is old and gray,
Brother is old and gray,
Brother is old and gray,
And he's only
He's only seventeen

Father said he was gonna give me something,
He gave me hate

Mother don't sit
Mother don't stand
Mother please don't send me

What happened to home
What happened to home sweet
What happened to home sweet
Home
