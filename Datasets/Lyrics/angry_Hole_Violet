And the sky was made of amethyst
And all the stars look just like little fish
You should learn when to go
You should learn how to say "no"

Might last a day, yeah
Mine is forever
But it last a day, yeah
Mine is forever

When they get what they want
They never want it again
When they get what they want
Well, they never want it again

Go on take everything
Take everything - I want you to
Go on take everything
Take everything - I want you to

And the sky was all violet
I wanna give my violet more violence
Hey, I'm the one with no soul
One above and one below

Might last a day, yeah
Mine is forever
But it last a day, yeah
Mine is forever

When they get what they want
They never want it again
When they get what they want
Well, they never want it again

Go on take everything
Take everything - I want you to
Go on take everything
Take everything - I dare you to

I told you from the start
Just how this would end
When I get what I want
Well, I never want it again

Go on take everything
Take everything - I want you to
Go on take everything
Take everything - I want you to

Flow right in your mind
You're mine

Go on take everything
Take everything - I want you to
Go on take everything
Take everything - I want you to

Go on take everything
Take everything - I want you to
Go on take everything
Take everything, take everything, take everything
