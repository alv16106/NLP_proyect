I woke up this morning and knew
That the world would test me
Come unglued
Is it me or do you feel my pain
This world makes my blood boil again


You rip the heart out of me
Rip the heart of me
You're making what he said
You rip the heart out of me
Rip the heart of me
Control and deceive me
You rip the heart out of me
Rip the heart of me

I try everything to please you
Gone out of my way like a fool
What makes me break down like a bitch
It's so hard to grow out of this ditch

You rip the heart out of me
Rip the heart of me
You're making what he said
You rip the heart out of me
Rip the heart of me
Control and deceive me
You rip the heart out of me
Rip the heart of me
You rip the heart out of me
Rip the heart of me
You're making what he said
You rip the heart out of me
Rip the heart of me
Control and deceive me
You rip the heart out of me
Rip the heart of me
