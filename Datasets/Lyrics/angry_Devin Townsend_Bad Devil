I wanna know what you all had for dinner
I wanna watch the rodeo
I wanna big city boy be a man, not a boy
I'm gonna meet you on down beside the bayou

I wanna be in your little friend
I wanna live in your underpants
I wanna big city boy be a man, not a boy
I'm gonna meet you on down beside the bayou

And we'll see how it feels when you're older
And we'll see how it feels when it's over
'Cause it's all just a waste of time
So enjoy what's on my mind

Someone should have said:

Train won't stop
Never gonna stop
And it's coming back to carry me back home

Leave me alone
With nowhere to go
And ride that wind back home

Bad devil
Bad devil
Bad devil, bad devil
Bad double-decker devil

Cry for me, baby
Lie for me, baby
Lay down before me, baby
And ride that wind back home

Bad devil
Bad devil
Bad devil, bad devil
Bas devil

And I've seen how I'll feel when I'm older
And I've seen how I'll feel when it's over
And it's not just a waste of time
So enjoy what's on my mind

Someone should have said:

Train won't stop
It's never gonna stop
And it's coming back to carry me back home

Cry for me, baby
Lie for me, baby
Lay down before me, baby
And ride that wind back home

Bad devil
Bad devil
Bad devil, bad devil
Bad double-decker devil

Bad devil
Bad devil
Bad devil
Bad devil
Bad devil
