Goodnite
Close your eyes and just sleep tight
I'll lie awake and watch you dream
To be sure that all of your dreams are pure

My dear don't you worry 'bout a thing
I'll be near to you all night
And through the evening
I'll be by your side

So goodnite
Close your eyes and just sleep tight
I'll lie awake and watch you dream
To be sure that all of your dreams are pure

While you slumber
In case you ever wonder
If a summer breeze just brushed your cheek
Know it's me

And Goodnite
Close your eyes and just sleep tight
I'll lie awake and watch you dream
To be sure that all of your dreams are pure
