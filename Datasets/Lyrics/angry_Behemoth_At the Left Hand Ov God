O, Serpent and Lion!
I invoke thee!
Inside the shrine called life
By the seven wonders
By myriad mortals
That gone
And are to come
Outside!
Outside desert of restriction
In act of rebellion
On the sea of motion
Stability of matter
By serenity, strength and beauty
By the mighty chant of every breath

In serpentine dance of blood cells
In simplicity of spells
Divine names, meta-games
I greet thy presence

Oh Snake! Thou art God!
Coiled underneath my throne
With thee, I reunite
With blood, we make this covenant
Myself, I redefine
Look in and above

There is more than the flesh
Look careful and thou may see
The unextinguished flame
The nectar of thy rage

I taste from the cup of fornication
And woman by my side
And scarlet is her skin
She's eager to rise
And so eager to please

Another day
Another eternity gone
And on the stairway to salvation
I walk alone among the falling stars
Looking for company
Where art thou?
Oh, lacerate ones!

Arise! My sweetest friend
Or be forever fallen
We have finally arrived
From prison of this life
To Kali's womb
Down to the earth
As angels of almighty god
Chaos!
'Tis our last fall
To touch our mother whore
The harlot of the saints
That spits on the rotten cross
Incinerate the icon
The symbol of all loss
To stand straight
At the left hand of God

Samael! be Thou my ally!
Join me among the bright hosts
Wondering neither way of light
Nor darkness
Of which seed
Sprouts dispassionately
In the summer of my life
