Sandy:

自小乾坤曾游֕ 
ZI XIAO QIAN KUN CENG YOU DANG
Strong from youth, I made a tour around the whole wide world
玉帝加封卷帘将 
YU DI JIA FENG JUAN LIAN JIANG
Then the Jade Emperor promoted me to Curtain-Raising General
失手打破玉玻璃 
SHI SHOU DA PO YU BO LI
By accident I broke a goblet of jade
遭贬流沙东岸上 
ZAO BIAN LIU SHA DONG AN SHANG
And was banished to the River of Flowing Sands
你敢行凶到我门?
NI GAN XING XIONG DAO WO MEN
Who dares to make a ruckus at my door?
拉入浪中剁肉酱! 
LA RU LANG ZHONG DUO ROU JIANG
I will grab you in the water and chop you into little pieces!
