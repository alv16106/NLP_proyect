Kill everybody in the whole word... Ahaha!-

'You have (something) of sustinence
There will be no oxygen to sustain the flame
There will be no air for your kind to breathe
You will wither and become a thing of the past'

(Lots of screaming)
'Destroying Angel!'

'You have decayed from within
Your redemption is (not sure what he says)
You have become one with your poison
You will submit to The Destroying Angel'

Chorus again, then first guitar solo.

'You have staggered on the brink of reprieve'
(This next line line sounds like it is in latin/another language)

Chorus, brief solo and final verse ending with:
'Destroying Angel!'
You have staggered on the brink of reprieve
Your book you're freezing hell
