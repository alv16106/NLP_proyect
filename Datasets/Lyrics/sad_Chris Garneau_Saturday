All the time in the world
Is lying right beside me,
But time does stop sometimes,
And back home, snow used to surprise me.

It's all two years ahead of me now.
Well, that's a lot of drinking.
You say I won't miss you, but I do.
It's a lot of never thinking.

If I don't black out,
I'll keep you inside me.
I can't promise you anything.

How long can a Saturday
Keep meaning all the same things.
I love all the things I said I love,
But forget why I'm still standing.

All the time in the world
Is lying right beside me.
If time does stop sometimes,
Let's try to spend it sleeping.

If I don't black out,
I'll keep you inside me.
I can't promise you anything.

I know, yeah, I'm slow.
I sleep the best in cold.
Dreams aren't what they used to be.
