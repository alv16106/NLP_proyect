Saying, I'm looking now at pictures of us.
I remember thinking, oh this will never be lust.
Oh, the songs it spoke for me when I couldn't speak.
Shame the band's broke up I just hope we'll remember these.

Hold it up, hold it tight,
Moments live or moments die.
Hold it up, hold it strong,
Stay right here where you belong.
Hold it up, hold it tight,
The only plans of mine might sound to you cliché.
But I just plan to live the rest of my life.

Saying I'm one, no no these pictures of us,
I don't want to say goodnight to records I love.
I was thinking of not growing old, forgetting and forgot.
I don't want to forget this and I don't want to be forgot

Hold it up, hold it tight,
Moments live or moments die.
Hold it up, hold it strong,
Stay right here where you belong.
Hold it up, hold it tight,
The only plans of mine might sound to you cliché.
But I just plan to live the rest of my life.

Hold it up, hold it tight,
Moments live or moments die.
Hold it up, hold it strong,
Stay right here where you belong.
Hold it up, hold it tight,
The only plans of mine might sound to you cliché.
But I just plan to live the rest of my life.
