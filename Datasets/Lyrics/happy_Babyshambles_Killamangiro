Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh

Why would you pay to see me in a cage?
And why would you pay to see someone in a cage?
Which the whole world calls a stage

Listen now
I have gone
You will know
I was the only one would have gladly died
Well done for what went wrong
In the eyes of the cruel and unwise

And they killed a man for his giro today
I have it all, he wasn't very gay
I didn't mind, I wasn't money mad anyway
They killed a man for his giro today

Wh-hy would you pay
And wh-hy would you pay
To see me in a cage
Which someone calls a stage

And oh
Now I have gone
And all this time
I've really gone
What went wrong
In the eyes of the unwell and unwise
And they killed a man for his giro today

On the off chance that your listening
You might like to know a la-de-la

When the night has gone
Ah you'll know I'm not the only one
Who would have gladly died
For what went wrong
In the eyes in the cruel and unwise

And they killed a man for his giro today
An I have it all

Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh
