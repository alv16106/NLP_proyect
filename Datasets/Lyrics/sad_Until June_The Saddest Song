And it's the saddest song you'll sing
When I'm alone with you
Your tears come down
You search your life for something new
And what you found is true
But now you're gone

Oh you're alone
And I'm waiting here for you
You're alone
And I'm waiting here for you

I walked the streets alone with you
Well just to be with you
But now you're gone
Fell in love with foolish things
Fell away from me
Now you're gone

And I'm waiting
And your jaw burn here
When you fail and you're lost
And I'm waiting for you
'Cause I know and you know

Not alone
And I'm waiting here for you
Not alone
And I'm waiting here for you
Oh no, not a lone
And I'm waiting here for you
Not alone, oh no when you're not alone
