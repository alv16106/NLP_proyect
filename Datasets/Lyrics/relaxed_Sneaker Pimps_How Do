Hey ho, who is this?
No one but me, my dear

Please come, say "How do"
The things I'll give to you
A stroke as gentle as a feather

Hey ho, I am here
Am I not young and fair?

Please come, say "How do"
The things I'll show to you

Would you have a wond'rous sight
The midday sun at midnight

Fair maid
White and red
Comb you smooth and stroke your head
