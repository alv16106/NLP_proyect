Uh, what up y'all? Yeah
Soundtrack, what's poppin baby? Woo
Y'all ain't know I go by the name of Lupe Fiasco
Representin that 1st & 15, yeah, uh
And this one right here
I dedicate this one right here to all my homies out there grindin
You know what I'm sayin?
Legally and illegally
Ha ha, you know what I'm talkin bout?
So check it out, uh

First got it when he was six
Didn't know any tricks
Matter fact first time he got on it he slipped
Landed on his hip and busted his lip
For a week he had to talk with a lisp like this
Now we can end the story right here
But Shorty didn't quit it was somethin in the air, yeah
He said it was somethin so appealin
He couldn't fight the feelin
Somethin about it
He knew he couldn't doubt it
Couldn't understand it, branded
Since the first kickflip he landed, uh
Labeled a misfit, a bandit
"Cuckoo Cuckoo Cuckoo"
His neighbors couldn't stand it
So, he was banished to the park
Started in the mornin wouldn't stop till after dark, yeah
When they said, "It's getting late in here,
So I'm sorry young man there's no skatin here"

And so he kick push kick push kick push kick push coast
And away he rolled
Just a rebel to the world with no place to go
And so he kick push kick push kick push kick push coast
So come and skate with me
Just a rebel lookin for a place to be
So let's kick, and push, and coast

Yeah, uh uh uh, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

My man got a little older
Became a better roller
Yeah, no helmet, "hellbent on killin hisself"
Is what his mama said, but he was feelin himself
Got a little more swagger in his style
Met his girlfriend she was clappin in the crowd
Love is what what was happening to him now, uh
He said I would marry you
But I'm engaged to these aerials and varials
And I don't think this board is strong enough to carry two
She said "Baow, I weigh a hundred and twenty pounds, now
Let me make one thing clear, I don't need to ride yours
I got mine right here"
So she took him to a spot 
He didn't know about
Some modern apartment parking lot
She said "I don't normally take dates in here"
Security came and said, "I'm sorry there's no skatin here"

And so they kick push kick push kick push kick push coast
And away they rolled
Just lovers intertwined with no place to go
And so they kick push kick push kick push kick push coast
So come and skate with me
Just a rebel lookin for a place to be
So let's kick, uh uh, and push, yeah yeah, and coast

Yeah, uh, ha ha, swanky, yeah, yeah

Before he knew he had a crew, that wasn't no punk
In they spitfire shirts and S.B. dunks
They would push till they couldn't skate no more
Office buildin lobbies wasn't safe no more
And it wasn't like they wasn't gettin chased no more
Just the freedom was better than breathin they said
An escape route they used to escape out
When things got crazy they needed to break out
They'd head to any place with stairs
Any good grinds, the world was theirs, uh
And they four wheels would take 'em there
Until the cops came and said, "There's no skatin here"

And so they kick push kick push kick push kick push coast
And away they rolled
Just rebels without a cause with no place to go
And so they kick push kick push kick push kick push coast
So come roll with me, just a rebel lookin for a place to be
So let's kick, uh uh, and push, yeah yeah, and coast

Ha ha, swanky, mmm, mmm
