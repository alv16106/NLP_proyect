I've been away, searching for a reason
Another purpose to find
I've sailed the seas, fought my many demons
I've looked to gods in the skies

I've stood in Hell, where many had to suffer
I stabbed the Devil in the eyes
Walked many roads to witness ancient idols
And found the great Gates of Fire

Had many storms question my conviction
Gave armies reason to rise
The Hangman's searching for bones he can borrow
While I escaped in the night!
Final plight!

Live again; I won't sin!
I'll be coming home
Tend your light, cause on this night
I'll be coming home

Escape the hell of capitulated mortals
And drink the blood of a king
A desert rain has washed away direction
Had angels looking after me so it seems

Live again; I won't sin!
I'll be coming home
Tend your light, cause on this night
I'll be coming home

My story ends not far from where it started
My weary limbs have grown old
I've seen the world through the eyes of a nomad
Home is where the heart is, I've been told
So I go!

Live again; I won't sin!
I'll be coming home
Tend your light, cause on this night
I'll be coming home

I'm coming home
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
