If you had not have fallen
Then I would not have found you
Angel flying too close to the ground
I patched up your broken wings
And hung around a while
Kept your spirits up
And your fever down
I know someday that you would fly away
'Cause love's the greatest healer to be found
So leave me if you need to
But I will still remember
Angel flying too close to the ground

If you had not have fallen
Then I would not have found you
Angel flying too close to the ground
I patched up your broken wings
And hung around a while
Kept your spirits up
And your fever down
I know someday that you would fly away
'Cause love's the greatest healer to be found
So leave me if you need to
But I will still remember
Angel flying too close to the ground

So fly on, fly on past the speed of sound
I'd rather see you up
Than see you down
So leave me if you need to
And I will still remember
Angel flying too close to the ground
So leave me if you need to
And I will still remember
Angel flying too close to the ground
Angel flying too close to the ground
