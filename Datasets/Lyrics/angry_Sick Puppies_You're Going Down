Define your meanin' of war
To me it's what we do when we're bored
I feel the heat comin' off of the blacktop
And it makes me want it more

Because I'm hyped up, out of control
If it's a fight, I'm ready to go
I wouldn't put my money on the other guy
If you know what I know that I know

It's been a long time comin' and the table's turned around
'Cause one of us is goin', one of us is goin' down
I'm not runnin', it's a little different now
'Cause one of us is goin', one of us is going down

Define your meaning of fun
Is it fuckin', druggin' or guns?
I feel the heat comin' off of the blacktop
So get ready for another one

Let's take a trip down memory lane (Do you remember me)
The words circling in my brain (And what you did to me?)
You can treat this like another all the same
But don't cry like a bitch when you feel the pain

It's been a long time comin' and the table's turned around
'Cause one of us is goin', one of us is goin' down
I'm not runnin', it's a little different now
'Cause one of us is goin', one of us is going down

This is hardly worth fightin' for
But it's the little petty shit that I can't ignore
When my fist hits your face
And your face hits the floor

It'll be a long time comin' 
Bet you got the message now
'Cause I was never going
Yeah, you're the one that's goin' down

One of us is goin' down
I'm not running, it's a little different now
'Cause one of us is goin', one of us is goin' down

One of us is goin' down
