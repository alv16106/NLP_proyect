If frizzy hair was a metaphor
For festival time,
Then this woman is a goddess
Of that festival shrine, met her
At a jam in that garden of sorts.
I must confess, god bless,
Some impure thoughts.
"Show us the money!"
Was the call of the night,
But no money could have bought
Even a piece of the pride, there might
Have been a sea of people;
I don't know, because
All I could see
Was that this woman, she glowed so.

Why, it's a pleasure to meet you;
Ya look like one incredible creature.
Wanna treat you fine,
Lets dance and grind,
Get so funk-inflicted it's a crime.
You're divine, you're sublime,
And, well, you blow my mind!

You're so sly!

She caterpillar, so good
That all the Greeks go "Killa!"
Break and enter, take ya like a glass of milk
Then "spill ya!"
Saw her coming, what a scene;
What I mean is
She got that sex coffee beam,
But she tastes like vanilla.
Well all right, she ignite
When we hit the floor
Like the vroom on a super Commodore.
Now, if it makes a good story,
Well it's just worthwhile;
With her it's like dealing stories
In the sprinkler style.
It's so sly!

Why, it's a pleasure to meet you;
Ya look like one incredible creature.
Wanna treat you fine,
Lets dance and grind,
Get so funk-inflicted it's a crime.
You're divine, you're sublime,
And, well, you blow my mind!

You're so sly! Why...

Oh... do the Louis!
Do the ch-ch-ch-chili! (Waah!)
Do the boom-shak, hit-the-sack, back-seats feeling all right! (Feeling all right)
Do the monkey shuffle!
Rock it with a fine strut!
Do the late checkout with a do-not-disturb sign outsi-i-ide!
And do the sly...

Why, it's a pleasure to meet you;
Ya look like one incredible creature.
Wanna treat you fine,
Lets dance and grind,
Get so funk-inflicted it's a crime.
You're divine, you're sublime,
And, well, you blow my mind!
