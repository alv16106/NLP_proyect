Dude, we gotta fuckin' write something new, c'mon
I don't like that, so far bad, off to a bad start
Better, closer, warmer, that's it, okay

I love ya baby but all I can think about is
Kielbasa sausage, your butt cheeks is warm
I check my dipstick, you need lubrication, honey
My kielbasa sausage has just got to perform
Now get it on!

I see you walkin', but all I can think about is
Dianetics, your butt cheeks is warm
I check my dipstick, you need lubrication, honey
My kielbasa sausage has just got to perform

Now I've been set loose-ah, I'm shooting my juice-ah
Right in your caboose, now fuckin' get it on!
Now get it on, get it on!

Dianetics Jr. much better than Krishna
Dianetics Jr. much better indeed
And all you people here you're tremendous
Except the people in the back
And you're smokin' up a big-ass bowl of weed
With me, me and KG

All right! Oh yeah! All right! Oh my God!
All the ladies in the house say yeah, yeah
C'mon, you muthafucka say a prayer
When ya fight, ya gotta fight fair
You muthafucka, ho, you muthafucka
You know what time it is?

It's a Tenacious D time, you muthafucka, go!
Fuck, yeah! Yeah, yeah!

Dude, that was TNT
