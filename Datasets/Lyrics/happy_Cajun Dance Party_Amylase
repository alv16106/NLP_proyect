Let's not forget, lets not forget what happened in the past
You were right, you were wrong, yeah but everything was fast
And when we build this ship remember to make it last
Increase the time it takes to paint and build the mast

Lets save this game for never
Or you know this could be chess forever
I'll take your piece
Then you'll take mine
Stalemate and we've just wasted time

Yeah the past's, the route of the growing that happens now
So lets remember not to turn on straight to a row
We can see through the haze of misty glaze
So now lets travel positively forward through the maze

Lets save this game for never
Or you know this could be chess forever
I'll take your piece
Then you'll take mine
Stalemate and we've just wasted time
We've just wasted time
We've just wasted time
We need a catalyst
We need a catalyst

We'll swim through the fields of hay
We'll swim through the fields of hay
We'll swim through the fields of hay
We'll swim through the fields of hay

You're the catalyst that makes things faster
Amylase will dry up the plaster
You're the catalyst that makes things faster
Amylase will dry up the plaster
You're the catalyst that makes things faster
Amylase will dry up the plaster
You're the catalyst that makes things faster
Amylase will dry up the plaster

You're the catalyst that makes things faster
Amylase will dry up the plaster
You're the catalyst that makes things faster
Amylase will dry up the plaster
You're the catalyst that makes things faster
Amylase will dry up the plaster
You're the catalyst that makes things faster
Amylase will dry up the plaster
