Utopia
The landfill crawls
Omens that back the truth
Omens that back the truth
Erase the veins of this dateline
As it tells the story
Of this roman fracture
Space time cliche

I can't believe
The feeble recipe
Civilization tastes so good
Nero has conquered the stars
No one ever saw the spacesuit togas
A wreath around the head
Like saturn's rings
Stole your recipe
The ghostship cemetery
We won't lie

Omens that back the truth
Omens that back the truth
Erase the veins of this dateline
As it tells the story
Of this roman fracture
Space time cliche
I can't believe
"E tu Brute" unfolding
Under the breath
Under the fall
Caligula time warp
Decadence in fleets came rain storming
Under threats of gluttony and lies
Stole your recipe
The ghostship cemetery
We won't lie
