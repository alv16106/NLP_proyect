Come on, step inside
And you'll realize
Tell me what you need, tell me what to be
What's your vision you see?
What do you expect of me?
I can't live that lie

Hey
I sing my words
I'm fucked at dealing
With your life's dead bodies everywhere
You really want me to be a good son 
Why?
You make me feel like no one

Let me strip the plain
Let me not give in
Free me of your lies
Inside my heart dies
Your dreams never have achieved 
Don't lay that shit on me
Let me live my life

Hey
I sing my words
I'm fucked at dealing
With your life's dead bodies everywhere
You really want me to be a good son 
Why?
You make me feel like no one

You want me to be, something I can never ever be
You want me to be, something I can never ever be

Hey
I sing my words
I'm fucked at dealing
With your life's dead bodies everywhere
You really want me to be a good son
Why?
You make me feel like no one

Dead bodies everywhere
Dead bodies everywhere
Dead bodies everywhere
Dead bodies everywhere
Dead bodies everywhere
Dead bodies everywhere
Dead bodies everywhere
Dead bodies everywhere
