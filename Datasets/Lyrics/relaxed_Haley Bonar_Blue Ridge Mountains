I ran from the devil

He was on my back

From the Blue Ridge Mountains

I followed your path

I jumped in the river to cleanse my skin

Well my skin froze again when the snow came down

Still in the dark I cry your name!

Jesus won't save your pain

Jesus won't save your pain

I learned you can't run from the dirt in your past

Mistakes don't disperse through the mountain pass

Some say it was the wind that dragged me down

But I know like a face is what made me drown

Still in the dark I cry your name!

Jesus won't save your pain

Jesus won't save your pain
