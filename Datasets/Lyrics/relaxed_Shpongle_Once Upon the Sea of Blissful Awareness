Waves of the soft spring wind
Waves of the soft spring wind
Love's flood tide is rising full
The moon of love is rising full

Sea of beauty
The moon of love is rising full
Love's flood tide

Laugh some, weep some, dance for joy
Laugh some, weep some, dance for joy
Laugh some, weep some, dance for joy
Laugh some, weep some, dance for joy

My mind craves nectar day and night
Like a blue lotus floating on the sea of love

Lingering in ashantic realms
Lingering in the akashic realms
Lingering in, lingering in the realms

Blue lotus floats
Blue lotus floats
Floating, floating
Floating, floating
Floating, floating

Laugh some, weep some, dance for joy
Laugh some, weep some, dance for joy
Laugh some, weep some, dance for joy
Laugh some, weep some, dance for joy

Some laugh, some weep, some dance for joy
Some laugh, some weep, some dance for joy

My mind craves nectar day and night
