On the way to your house
I feel new, I feel color, I'm with you
On the way to your room
I'm alive, I'm a flutter, I'm a bloom

And time, it stands still
And we wait until
The light
Flickers and fades

On the way to your heart
I feel blue, I feel a stutter without you

Does this light have a chance?

On the way to your house
I feel new, I feel color, I'm with you
