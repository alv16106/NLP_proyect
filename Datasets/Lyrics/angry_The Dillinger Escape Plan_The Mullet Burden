Such worthless crust and crazed
Now cring to slap the wrist
I sense you cracked and weak
The nonexistent won't care
When you fail to wake
I sense you cracked and weak
I wonder if you would
I wonder if you could
Please just a small taste
Of the offer unrefused
Bonded by a muddy crippled story
And now I wonder if you really ever could
You're no good
Self-sodomize once more
Whore
Slut
Et fragile and tight
A reckless mangled conscience
With only the imbalance of evils
Wait for guidance
End it all now
