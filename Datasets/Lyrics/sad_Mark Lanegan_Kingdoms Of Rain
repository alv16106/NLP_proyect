Are those halos in your hair
Or diamonds shining there
Without a hope, without a prayer
This rain beats down like death
You turn your eyes to better men
Before I go I'm hangin' a cross on the nail
I hung one for you now

Girl lay your shame to rest
Then hold the lies close to your breast
You stoop to feed the crows
Some scraps of truth already cold
Before I go I'm hangin' a cross on the nail
I hung one for you now
And every kingdom of rain comes pourin' down
'Cause I loved you so long
'Cause I loved you so long

Would you put halos in your hair
Without a hope without a prayer
What lies close to your breast
Then finally lay your shame to rest
Before I go I'm hangin' a cross on the nail
I hung one for you now
And every kingdom of rain comes pourin' down
'Cause I loved you so long
'Cause I loved you so long
'Cause I loved you so long
