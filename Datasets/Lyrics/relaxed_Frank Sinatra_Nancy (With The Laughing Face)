If I don't see her each day, I miss her
Gee what a thrill, each time I kiss her
Believe me, I've got a case
On Nancy, with the laughing face

She takes the winter and she makes it summer
But summer could take a few lessons from her
Picture a tomboy in lace
That's Nancy with the laughing face

Did you ever hear mission bells ringing?
Well, she'll give you the very same glow
When she speaks you would think it was singing
Just hear her say hello

I swear to goodness, you can't resist her
Sorry for you she has no sister
No angel could replace
Nancy, with the laughing face

Keep Betty Grable, Lamour and Turner
She makes my heart a charcoal burner
It's heaven when I embrace
My Nancy with the laughing face
