Voodoo Lady
Shakin' that stick and drivin' me crazy
Your eyes are red and hazy
Doin' that stuff that you do
Messin' me up wit your voodoo

You drive me crazy with that 
Boogie oogie oogie oogie oogie oogie oogie oogie
You drive me crazy with that 
Boogie boogie boogie 

Your lips are hot and spicy
Servin' up red beans and bats
At midnight she's a' howlin' and stompin'
Makin' love to the gators in the swampin'

You drive me crazy with that 
Boogie oogie oogie oogie oogie oogie oogie oogie
You drive me crazy with that 
Boogie boogie boogie 

I feel you now inside me
Never once did you deny me
Doin' that stuff that you do
Knockin' me out with your voodoo

You drive me crazy with that
Boogie oogie oogie oogie oogie oogie oogie oogie
You drive me crazy with that
Boogie boogie boogie

Voodoo Lady
Shakin' that stick
Drivin' me crazy
Voodoo Lady, oh yeah

Voodoo Lady
Shakin' that stick and drivin' me crazy
Your eyes are red and hazy
Doin' that stuff that you do
Messin' me up wit your voodoo

You drive me crazy with that 
Boogie oogie oogie oogie oogie oogie oogie oogie
You drive me crazy with that
Boogie boogie boogie
