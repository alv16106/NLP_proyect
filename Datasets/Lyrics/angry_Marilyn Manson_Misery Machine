Man in the front got a sinister grin
Careen down highway 666
We wanna go, crush the slow, as the pitchfork bends
The needles grow
My arms are wheels, my legs are wheels, my blood is pavement
We're gonna ride to the abbey of Thelema
To the abbey of Thelema
Blood is pavement

The grill in the front is my sinister grin
Bugs in my teeth make me sick sick sick
The objects may be larger than they appear in the mirror
My arms are wheels, my legs are wheels, my blood is pavement
We're gonna ride to the abbey of Thelema
To the abbey of Thelema
Blood is pavement

When you ride you're ridden, when you ride you're ridden

I am fueled by filth and fury
Do what I will, I will hurry there, there

My arms are wheels, my legs are wheels, blood is pavement
Blood is pavement
