Mrs. Lovett:
There was a barber and his wife.
And he was beautiful...
A proper artist with a knife,
But they transported him for life.
And he was beautiful...
spoken:
Barker his name was.
Benjamin Barker.

Todd: (spoken)
What was his crime?

Mrs. Lovett:(spoken)
Foolishness...
sung:
He had this wife, ya see.
Pretty little thing,
Silly little nit
Had her chance for the moon on a string...
Poor thing!
Poor thing!
There were this judge, ya see...
Wanted her like mad!
Every day he sent her a flower
But did she come down from her tower?
Just sat up there and sobbed by the hour
Poor thing!
Poor fool!
Ah, but there was worse yet to come,
Poor thing!

Well, Beadle calls on her all polite
Poor thing!
Poor thing!
The judge, he tells her, is all contrite
He blames himself for her dreadful plight
She must come straight to his house tonight!
Poor thing!
Poor thing!
Of course when she goes there,
Poor thing,
Poor thing!
They're having this ball all in masks
There's no one she knows there
Poor dear,
Poor thing!
She wonders, tormented and drinks,
Poor thing!
The judge has repented, she thinks,
Poor thing!
"Oh where is Judge Turpin?" she asks...
He was there, all right--
Only not so contrite!
She wasn't no match for such craft, ya see
And everyone thought it so droll
They figured she had to be daft, ya see
So all of them stood there and laughed, ya see!
Poor soul!
Poor thing!

Sweeney Todd: (spoken)

(Screams) NO!

Would no one... have mercy on her?!

Mrs. Lovett: (spoken)

(Whispers) So it is you... Benjamin Barker!

Sweeney Todd (spoken)

(Yells) NO!

Not Barker. It's Todd now--Sweeney Todd. And he will have his revenge.
