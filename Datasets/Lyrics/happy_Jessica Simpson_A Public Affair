There go the street lights - the night's officially on,
I got the green light - to do what ever I want,
I'm gonna stand - outside - the box - and put the rules on hold, tonight Carte blanche first class for the evening

Ready, set, go

All the girls stepping out for a public affair
(All night, let's rock cause the party don't stop)
All the cameras come out for a public affair
(Who cares, let's rock, cause the party don't stop)

Hey baby, I see you looking over here baby
Are you going to keep looking - or get up?
And talk to me
Here's an opportunity that you don't want to miss

Tonight Carte Blanche first class for the evening

Ready, set, go

All the girls stepping out for a public affair
(All night, let's rock cause the party don't stop)
All the cameras come out for a public affair
(Who cares, let's rock, cause the party don't stop)

Oh, oh

Do what you want to do, tonight the world does not exist
No, no, no
Move how you want to move, all my girls work it out - like this

Give me room to shake, shake, shake, shake

All the girls stepping out for a public affair
(All night, let's rock cause the party don't stop)
All the cameras come out for a public affair
(Who cares, let's rock, cause the party don't stop)

All girls for a public affair
(All night, let's rock cause the party don't stop)
All the cameras come out for a public affair
(Who cares, let's rock, cause the party don't stop)

All night don't stop, *giggle*, Who cares? Let's rock
All night don't stop (Don't stop don't stop)
Who cares lets rock

Oh, oh, oh
Hey, baby
Ah, oh, oh, oh,
Ah, oh, oh

All the girls stepping out for a public affair
(All night, let's rock cause the party don't stop)
All the cameras come out for a public affair
(Who cares, let's rock, cause the party don't stop) (Stop, Stop, Stop, stop, stop, stop)
