With a purposeful grimace and a terrible sound
He pulls the spitting high tension wires down

Helpless people on subway trains
Scream for God as he looks in on them

He picks up a bus and he throws it back down
As he wades through the buildings toward the center of town

Oh, no, they say he's got to go
Go, go, Godzilla, yeah
Oh, no, there goes Tokyo
Go, go, Godzilla, yeah

Oh, no, they say he's got to go
Go, go, Godzilla, yeah
Oh, no, there goes Tokyo
Go, go, Godzilla, yeah
