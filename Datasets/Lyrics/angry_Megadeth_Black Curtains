Hey! Look around you
Everything's helter-skelter
Listen up! I warn you
Run for cover, run
Bang! It happened
Time's up, armageddon
Fire! Meltdown
The sky is crumbling in

Black curtains
Neverending
Black curtains

Escape? You're joking
Can't find no place to run
Hair is burning
My flesh is bubbling up
Blood is boiling
Taste copper on my tongue
Fate is coming
Welcome it with a smile

Black curtains
Neverending
Black curtains... Fall!
Black curtains
Neverending
Black curtains

(Something's under my skin)
(Something's very strange, that's playing with my mind)
(Telling me to kill you)

Am I dreaming?
My heart pounds my chest
Held for ransom
In a spider's web
Suffocating
No one hears my calls
Neverending
Till the black curtain falls

Snakes surround me
Offering their death kiss to me
Down... I'm drowning
How long I'll hold my breath?
Dogs are chasing
My legs are paralyzed
Pray... don't find me
My life is fading fast

Black curtains
Neverending
Black curtains... Fall!
Black curtains
Neverending
Black curtains
