I'm gonna go ahead and wager that you'll never listen to another song of mine.
I can't say I blame you, either, 'cause if you made records, you ain't going to catch me listening to that shit.
But if you do, I just want you to know I didn't make this to hurt you, god knows you done hurt enough.
Just... I don't know, trying to make some real shit, you know.

Bye
You ain't never going to see me again if I can help it
Little felon take it easy
Fresh out of forced tears, kisses, and hugs
You about to lose the company your misery loves
Ain't never did nothing but try to cure your disease
At least help the symptoms, 'stead you infected me
I'm not the kind of man to draw a line in the sand
If you've got to draw at all then it's time for you to scram
P.S. you can keep all this shit
And hang around your broke friends and call yourself rich
Struggling I did with you was all for nothing
It was never enough, your heart set on suffering
I admit that I was weak in the beginning
I wanted someone to need me instead of a friendship
I didn't think I deserved a true partner
So I transferred the arrangement I had with my momma
Since you never listened to a word I ever said
Maybe seeing this door slam will get it through you head
I don't love you; I don't think I ever did
And if you hadn't tried to kill me, I'd have stayed for the kid

(x2)
There's nothing more for us to say
Got my mind made up, I'm walking away
Sometimes we just outgrow the role that we play
Hope you find a happy ending to your story someday

Round and round and round we used to go
I never fucked you right or made enough bread, I know
If I'm such a bastard and mistreated you so
Then how is it you're losing your mind to see me go?
Truth be told, I held you together
For all them years and I cheated on you never
Defended your honor, took in your momma
When she tried to rehab and had your back through the drama
You've got a sick stone under your ribs
Where a heart is supposed to live
Sick twisted and vindictive with your windows dim
Baby in that wicked hardboiled fist you must shiver
How you threaten to kill the most precious
Gift that you'll ever be blessed with
Unless you're twisted, demented, and depressed as shit
And alone 'cause you faithfully slayed your friendships
Since you never listened to a word I ever said
Maybe seeing this door slam will get it through your head
You don't love me; I don't think you ever did
And if you hadn't tried to kill me I'd have stayed for the kid
