Some are reaching few are there
Want to rein from a hero's chair
Some are scared to fly so high
Well this is how we have to try
Have no envy and no fear
Have no envy, no fear

Brother, brother we all see
You're hiding out so painfully
See yourself come out to play
A lover's rain will wash away
Your envy and your fear
So have no envy and no fear

When your sister turns to leave
Only when she's most in need
Take away the cause of pain
By showing her we're all the same

Have no envy and no fear
Have no envy and no fear

Every day we try to find
Search our hearts and our minds
The place we used to call our home
Can't be found when we're alone

So have no envy and no fear
Have no envy and no fear
