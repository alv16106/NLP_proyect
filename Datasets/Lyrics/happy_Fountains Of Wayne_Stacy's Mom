Stacy can I come over after school, ooh-hoo ooh-hoo? (after school)
We can hang around by the p-p-p-pool, ooh-hoo ooh-hoo (hang by the pool)
Did your mom get back from her business trip? (business trip)
Is she there, or is she trying to give me the slip, eh-he, eh-he? (give me the slip)
You know I'm not the little boy that I used to be
I'm all grown-up now, baby, can't you see?

Stacy's mom has got it going on
She's all I want and I've waited for so long
Stacy, can't you see?
You're just not the girl for me
I know it might be wrong
But I'm in love with Stacy's mom

Stacy, do you remember when I mowed your lawn? (mowed your lawn)
Your mom came out with just a towel on, oh-ho oh-hon (towel on)
I could tell she liked me from the way she stared (way she stared)
And the way she said, "You missed a spot over there", eh-here eh-here (spot over there)
And I know that you think it's just a fantasy
But since your dad walked out, your mom could use a guy like me

Stacy's mom has got it going on
She's all I want and I've waited for so long
Stacy, can't you see?
You're just not the girl for me
I know it might be wrong
But I'm in love with Stacy's mom

Stacy's mom has got it going on (she's got it going on)
She's all I want and I've waited for so long (waited and waited)
Stacy, can't you see?
You're just not the girl for me
I know it might be wrong
But I'm in love with (Stacy's mom, oh-ho oh-ho)

(I'm in love with) (Stacy's mom, oh-ho oh-ho)
(Wait a minute) Stacy, can't you see?
You're just not the girl for me
I know it might be wrong
But I'm in love with Stacy's mom
