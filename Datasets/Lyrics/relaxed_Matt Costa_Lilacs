You were right, I was up all night
Thinking about you
Dreamed I choked on your kaleidoscope
Now you still look deadly

My fatal flower how the tigers all laughed
As I ran along the well worn paths

Sapphire eye looks down on my lilacs
Down on my lilacs, down on my lilacs
Down on me, down on me, down on

Insincere as we rolled for years in turning barrels
I washed my hands in the lake
As you blew it all away with roman candles
So take your fever, let me wallow alone
The callus on your eyes have grown

Sapphire eye looks down on my lilacs
Down on my lilacs, down on my lilacs
Down on me, down on me, down on

And your faults have me stoned
Paying rent to your ghost
Torn up by a frightened little girl

I thought that you were right
So I was up all night thinking about you
I thought that you were right, you were right
You were right, you were

You were right, and I was up all night
Thinking about you
And I couldn't speak
Covered with bees you flew above me
Figured it all out, I think you've had enough time
I've had long enough to change my mind

And a sapphire eye looks down on my lilacs
Down on my lilacs, down on my lilacs
Down on me, down on me, down on

And your faults have me stone
Paying rent to your ghost
Torn up by a frightened little girl
I thought that you were right
And I was up all night thinking about you

You were right, so I was up all night
Thinking about you
I thought you were right, you were right
You were right, you were
