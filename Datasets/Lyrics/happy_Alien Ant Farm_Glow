I never thought that you'd find out I did it
I was so scared that you'd leave, so I hid it
I know we said that we'd always be honest
So now I went out and messed up our nest

It finally seems like we've turned into strangers
It's gotten so bad, there's just no more anger
So now it seem like we can't get no further
I can't believe I'll be bright for another

I'll be the switch she turns on
She'll be mine too, I get off
I'll be the fuse that she blows
And even with the lights out, we'll glow

So where's the sun? It shone no love on your face
Under the moon and with the girl that's in your place
And even Edison has no idea
Of all the blackouts I've caused you and me

I'll be the switch she turns on
She'll be mine too, I get off
I'll be the fuse that she blows
And even with the lights out, we'll glow

I'll be the switch she turns on
She'll be mine too, I get off
I'll be the fuse that she blows
And even with the lights down real low

We'll glow, we'll glow, we'll glow

I'll be the switch she turns on
She'll be mine too, I get off
I'll be the, I'll be the fuse she blows
And even with the lights out, we'll glow

I'll be the switch she turns on
She'll be mine too, I get off
I'll be the fuse that she blows
And even with the lights out, we'll glow

I'll be the switch she turns on
She'll be mine too, I get off
I'll be the fuse that she blows
And even with the lights out, we'll glow

I'll be the, I'll be the fuse
I'll be the, I'll be the fuse
