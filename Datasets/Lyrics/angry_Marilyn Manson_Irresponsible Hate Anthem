When you are suffering, know that I have betrayed you

And all the children sing
We hate love
We love hate

I am so all-American, I'd sell you suicide
I am totalitarian, I've got abortions in my eyes
I hate the hater, I'd rape the raper
I am the animal who will not be himself

Fuck it
Fuck it
Fuck it
Fuck it

Hey victim
Should I black your eyes again?
Hey victim
You were the one who put the stick in my hand
I am the ism, my hate's a prism
Let's just kill everyone and let your god sort them out

Fuck it
Fuck it
Fuck it
Fuck it

Everybody's someone else's nigger
I know you are so am I
I wasn't born with enough middle fingers
I don't need to choose a side

I better, better, better, better not say this
Better, better, better, better not tell
I hate the hater, I'd rape the raper
I am the idiot who will not be himself

Fuck it
Fuck it
Fuck it
Fuck it

Everybody's someone else's nigger
I know you are so am I
I wasn't born with enough middle fingers
I don't need to choose a side

America cannot see anything
America cannot see anything
America cannot see anything
History was written by winners

Fuck it
Fuck it
Fuck it
Fuck fuck fuck

Everybody's someone else's nigger
I know you are so am I
I wasn't born with enough middle fingers
I don't need to choose a side
