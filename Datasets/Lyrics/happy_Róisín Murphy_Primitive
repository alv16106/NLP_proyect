From the primordial soup
Out of the din and the gloom we came
We are animals by any other name

From the primordial soup
Out of the din and the gloom we came
We are animals, one unbroken chain

I need to get you out of your cave man
I need to let you out of your cage and set you free
If tonight's the night
I'm gonna show you I ain't got no game plan

Out from under a rock
From a prehistoric sea we crawl
We are animals, animal one and all

Out from under a rock
From the prehistoric sea we came
We are animals, animals, one unbroken chain

I know what you're searching for
I pray you find it on your instinct
I, I don't need you hurting boy animalistic

I need to get you out of your cave man
I wanna let you out of your cage and set you free
If tonight's the night
I'm gonna show you I ain't got no game plan

I need to get you out of your cave man
I wanna let you out of your cage and set you free
If tonight's the night
I'm gonna show you I ain't got no game plan

If you call out tonight
And hear the call of the wild reply
You are animal, animal not so deep inside

If you call out in vain
Every one of us just the same
We are animal, dare not speak its name

I know what you're searching for
I pray you find it on your instinct
I, I don't need your hurting boy animalistic

I need to get you out of your cave man
I wanna let you out of your cage and set you free
If tonight's the night
I'm gonna show you I ain't got no game plan

I need to get you out of your cave man
I wanna let you out of your cage and set you free
If tonight's the night
I'm gonna show you I ain't got no game plan
