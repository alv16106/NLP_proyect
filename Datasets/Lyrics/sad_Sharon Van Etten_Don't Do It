Said you need to do it 'cause you can't feel it tonight
Well, you can if you want to
Want to take you outside, want to show you the sky
To remind you why you shouldn't

Do your worst if you can, do your worst if you can do it
You can if you want
You can take it, yeah, you want to run
Said you wanted to then kissed the gun
You can if you want to

And you want to do it, and you want to do it
If you want to do it, you are going to do it
Even if I don't want you to

Say it outright that you don't want to see me tonight
And you won't if you don't want to
Hide it from me if you must
Hide it from me if you don't trust
Anything I say right to you

And you want to do it, if you want to do it
You will if you want to
And you want to do it, if you want to do it
You will if you want to
And you want to do it, and you want to do it
If you want to do it, you are going to do it
Even if I don't want you to

I was inside painting your name on the window
I was somewhere in sight
And I wanted to find out why you're hiding
I was tired of the fight

Look me in the eyes, say you can't do it
Look me in the eyes, say you can't do it
But you will if you want to
Look me in the eyes, say you can't do it
Look me in the eyes, say you can't do it
But you will if you want to
And you want to do it, and you want to do it
If you want to do it, you are going to do it
Even if I don't want you to

Shake it down, so much better
Tell me that you don't know what you do
And you want to do it, if you want to do it
You will if you want to
And you want to do it, if you want to do it
You will if you want to
And you want to do it, if you want to do it
You will if you want to

I wish I could make you right
