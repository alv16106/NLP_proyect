Don't say it's over
Cause that's the worst news I could hear.
I swear that I will
Do my best to be here
Just the way you like it.
Even though it's hard to hide,
Push my feelings all aside
I will rearrange my plans
And change for you.

If I could go back
That's the first thing I would do
I swear that I would
Do my best to follow through,
Come up with a master plan,
A homerun hit, a winning stand
A guarantee, and not promise
That I'd never let your love slip
From my hands.

If it's the beaches,
If it's the beaches, sands you want,
Then you will have them.
If it's the mountains, bending rivers
Then you will have them.
If it's a wish to run away,
Then I will grant it.
Take whatever you think of,
While I go gas up the truck.
Pack the old love letters up.
We will read them when we forget
Why we lived here.
