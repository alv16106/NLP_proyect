And now ladies and gentlemen, here's the event you've all been waiting for

You came twice last year like a Sears catalog
'Cause your last boyfriend makes love like Boss Hogg
Well now you're seeing me but soon I'll have you seein' God
'Cause girl I'll get you pantin' like you're Pavlov's dog
Like a DC-10 guaranteed to go down
But baby your black box is the one that I found
I'll give you the gift that keeps on givin' it won't cost ya any money
Then she grabbed me by the ears and said kiss me where it smells funny

So down I go like I'm 2000 Flushes
I can tell I'm doin' somethin' right by the way that she blushes
She's the one that's speechless I'm the one that's tongue-tied
She's thinkin' holy mackerel I'm thinkin' tuna on the side
There must be somethin' wrong with Al Pacino's nose
'Cause the Scent Of A Woman is like rotten tomatoes
Yeah I'm snorkelin' for clams it doesn't matter if I wanna be
Don't come up for air until you kiss me where it smells funny

Drop my face below her waist and stay on third base
I can tell that cherry's ripe by the way it tastes
Yeah I could make a lot of wine with the yeast I find inside her panties
And then drink it while I'm eating out down at the Seafood Shanty

Drop my face below her waist and stay on third base
I can tell that cherry's ripe by the way it tastes
Yeah I could make a lot of wine with the yeast I find inside her panties
And then drink it while I'm eating out down at the Seafood Shanty

Drop my face below her waist and stay on third base
I can tell that cherry's ripe by the way it tastes
Yeah I could make a lot of wine with the yeast I find inside her panties
And then drink it while I'm eating out down at the Seafood Shanty

Drop my face below her waist and stay on third base
I can tell that cherry's ripe by the way it tastes
Yeah I could make a lot of wine with the yeast I find inside her panties
