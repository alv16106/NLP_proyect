One,
One perfect lie
Was it told 
Too soon? And
One,
One perfect life
Turned to stone
Cold mercy

I
Kneel
Down by
Your grave
I
Kneel
Down torn
And guilty

Did
I let you down?
Say goodbye
Too soon? And
Did
You understand
My mistake?
Forgive me

I
Kneel
Down by
Your side
I
Kneel
Down scared
And helpless

One perfect lie wrapped in kindness and tears
I wish I believed in your Heaven
One perfect life led by blind faith and trust
If God has a heart He will find you

Torn and guilty
Torn and guilty
Torn and guilty
I'm torn and guilty
I'm torn and guilty
Torn and guilty
Torn and guilty
I'm torn and guilty
I'm torn and guilty
