Let the drive sequence begin. Hit it, Pinback...

She lays among the flowers
And spreads among the sheets.
She counts the clouds for hours
And turns them into sheep.
They sleep along the rivers
And shower in the deep
And breath in all that's Autumn,
Till Winter stays.

They almost didn't find her,
A couple times she walked to the train tracks

Sometimes her forehead gets hot.
It comes and goes.
Sometimes the medicine can heal her kind.
It's like a hurricane inside her.
Inside the hurricane her mind gets blown.

It's like a hurricane inside her.
