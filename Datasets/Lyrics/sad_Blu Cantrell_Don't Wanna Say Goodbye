I can barely remember what it was that made me walk away
But something deep inside my heart 
Is tellin' me I still love you, baby
Now I'm walking all alone, this cold December day
I see you come to me, but I can't see
'Cause all I wanna do is tell you, baby

How many times I
Daydreamed of what we could've been
How many times I
Find myself asking why

'Cause I will never stop lovin' you
Can you tell me what I gotta do?
'Cause I never wanna say goodbye
Don't wanna say goodbye again
Now I know that I was meant for you
One more time, I can't bear to lose
I don't ever wanna say goodbye
Don't wanna say goodbye again

We thought it'd last forever, but I was swept away
What I thought I knew it wasn't true
I wish I would've known before today
I always said I'd never let myself lose again
Yes, I found a way
What I gotta do to get myself back to you?

How many times I
Daydreamed of what we could've been
How many times I
Find myself asking why

'Cause I will never stop lovin' you
Can you tell me what I gotta do?
'Cause I never wanna say goodbye
Don't wanna say goodbye again
Now I know that I was meant for you
One more time I can't bear to lose
I don't ever wanna say goodbye
Don't wanna say goodbye again

How can I get through to you?
I'm not even close to over you
Tellin' you the truth
Got me shaky
There's nothing I won't do
To get you right back next to me
The way it's supposed to be

'Cause I will never stop lovin' you
Can you tell me what I gotta do?
'Cause I never wanna say goodbye
Don't wanna say goodbye again
Now I know that I was meant for you
One more time I can't bear to lose
I don't ever wanna say goodbye
Don't wanna say goodbye again

'Cause I will never stop lovin' you
Can you tell me what I gotta do?
'Cause I never wanna say goodbye
Don't wanna say goodbye again
Now I know that I was meant for you
One more time I can't bear to lose
I don't ever wanna say goodbye
Don't wanna say goodbye again

And I 
Love you
'Cause I
Say goodbye

And I 
For you
