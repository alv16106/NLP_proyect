Now who, who, who do you think I am?
Well, I built this ark with Japheth, Shem, and Ham.
Now what, what, what do you think it's gonna do
When I live by faith and now my work is through?

It's gonna rain (It's gonna rain)
I said it's gonna rain (It's gonna rain)
Yes, It's gonna rain (It's gonna rain.)
I'm so happy to say (It's gonna rain)
Oh It's gonna rain (It's gonna rain) on the world today

Now when, when, when I am in doubt
And I think that things for me will never work out,
But where, where, where the heart is true,
Ya know Lord, your God, will never forsake you.

It's gonna rain (It's gonna rain)
I said it's gonna rain (It's gonna rain)
Yes, It's gonna rain (It's gonna rain.)
I'm so happy to say (It's gonna rain)
Oh It's gonna rain (It's gonna rain) on the world today

Repeat verse 1 (drums only)

It's gonna rain (It's gonna rain)
I said it's gonna rain (It's gonna rain)
Yes, It's gonna rain (It's gonna rain.)
I'm so happy to say (It's gonna rain)
Oh It's gonna rain (It's gonna rain) on the world today
Forty days and forty nights (It's gonna rain)
Forty days and forty nights (It's gonna rain)
Hallileua, it's all right (It's gonna rain)
Everybody's sleepin' tight (It's gonna rain)
Oh, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right, it's gonna rain tonight.
Repeat chorus three times
