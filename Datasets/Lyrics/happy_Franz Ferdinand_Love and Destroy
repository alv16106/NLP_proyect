I'm so free I could lacerate
Rip the robes right off of my chest
I'll fly high above the muscovites' sky
I'm going to rip, rip, oh I'll never rest
I'm going to meet you at midnight
I'm going to meet you at midnight
You see, I'm not used to living alone
I gotta learn how to live or I'll die.

I'm so free as I'm naked
Shining silver under the moon
I'm high above the muscovites' sky
I'm gonna rip, rip out of this room
I'm going to meet you at midnight
I'm going to meet you at midnight
You see, I'll forget about living alone
As I learn how to live and to die

Margarita, love and destroy
Margarita, love and destroy
Margarita, love and destroy
Margarita, love and destroy

I'm so free as I meet you
Welcoming black, your the Queen of the ball
It's dark beneath the muscovites' sky
But you give, you give me it all
I'm here with you at midnight
I'm here with you at midnight
You see, now I know I'm never alone
As I learn, I learn how to die

Margarita, love and destroy
Margarita, love and destroy
Margarita, love and destroy
Margarita

Margarita, love and destroy
Margarita, love and destroy
Margarita, love and destroy
Margarita, love and destroy
