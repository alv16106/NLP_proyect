"Look, I know the supernatural is something
That isn't supposed to happen
But it does happen"

Jesus lived his life
In a cheap hotel
On the edge of Route 66 yeah
He lived a dark and twisted life
And he came right back
Just to do it again

Eye for an eye
And a tooth for the truth
I ain't never seen
A demon warp dealin' a
Ring a ding rhythm
Or jukebox racket my
Mind can't clutch the feeling

Devil man, devil man calling
Devil man, running in my head
Yeah

Devil man, devil man calling
Devil man, running in my head
Yeah

Hell hounds lead
At the cowardly kings
And carry souls
Across the river Styx, yeah
They see no evil and feel no pain
Sucking juice from a fallen angel

I dreamed I was
A super nova fucker nitro'
Burning and fuel injection
Feed the gods a strychnine soul
A motherfucker of invention

Devil man, devil man calling
Devil man, running in my head
Yeah

Devil man, devil man calling
Devil man, running in my head
Yeah

"Insipientia corde suo, non es deus
Non est vita qui adorem
Non es usque ad unum
Es excommunicatus, ex unione fidelium"

"It is not heresy, and I will not recant"

Yeah inbreed the witches
And worship the dogs
Deformed and fuckin' lazy
Damn yourself
And choke on my name
I'd love to love you baby

Dead ringer rats swinging in the trees
Immaculate conception
Bury me an angel
God I need some inspiration

Devil man, devil man calling
Devil man, running in my head
Yeah

Devil man, devil man calling
Devil man, running in my head
Yeah
