Run, Tommy, run
Did you get all you want?
Did you drink their world dry
And extinguish all the sunshine?

I didn't say that I felt the same
You just took it as read
As I closed all the blinds
And put you to bed
And read you all the last rites

It serves as a warning to me,
Just like most of these days do
'Cause I just wish that
I could've just left you there
Sitting in your own shit
'Cause I know that you would, me too

See, 'cause I've gone through all this before
And I've bought that skinny tee
With a big, black gaping hole where the heart should be
That says, "Baby, I renounce thee"

Don't you die on me now

A kiss is now a circus show
The big, top tent and neon glow
Through spectacles of rainbow red
You never feel your love till it's dead

Arm's length keep him
Stop and don't endure
No one ever paused
Empty as a hole and ever depleting

What I'm for makes us whole
A bankruptcy of love
Could not swim above
Empty as a hole and ever depleting

I recoil from the blast
And look around me
Neither friend nor foe
Empty as a hole and ever depleting
