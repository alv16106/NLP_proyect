If I know what I know 
That no one will watch over you 
And someone shouldn't really tell me 
What I want to know
I know oh ho
I know that matters don't matter as much 
As you think they do

Cause you will only be yourself
And you can never be yourself
And you will only be yourself
When you understand what you know

How long will we go on 
With the modern way of letting go
Tell me how long will we go on 
With the modern way of letting you go

If I know what I know 
Losing isn't learning to be lost 
It's learning to know when you're lost
And I know what I know 
I wanna make the most of what it seems like

You will only be yourself
And you can never be yourself
And you will only be yourself
When you understand what you know

How long will we go on 
With the modern way of letting you go
Tell me how long will we go on 
With the modern way of letting you go
