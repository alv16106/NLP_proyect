Una:
I gave you all you desired
All that you needed, boy, I provided
I let you into my head, into my bed
And that's a privilege
I had your back in the answers
You took the dollars, I took the chances
Defended, battled and fought
'Cause I really thought you loved me

I don't know where to start or where to stop, no
But I know I am done, I've had enough

Una:
So fall out of my hands, out of my heart
And when you hit the ground
You'll be sorry that I'm not around
I will watch you while you
Fall out of your mind, out of your fantasy
When you hit the wall, think of me
I'll be on the top just watching you fall

Vanessa:
You said that you were the strong one
I was the girl and I was the young one
I kept your feet on the ground
My head in the realms, I had you
You told me you were so grateful
I was with you and I was so faithful
I stood by in all that you said
And all that you did, I loved you!

Vanessa and Frankie:
I don't know how to act or what to say
Vanessa:
But I know I am good, I'll be okay, and you

All:
Fall out of my hands, out of my heart
And when you hit the ground
You'll be sorry that I'm not around
I will watch you while you
Fall out of your mind, out of your fantasy
When you hit the wall, think of me
Vanessa:
I'll be on the top just watching you fall
I'll be on the top just watching you fall

All:
Fall,
Fall,
Fall,
Fall, (Frankie: Oh oh whoa oh)
Fall,
Fall
(Vanessa: I want you to fall)

All:
Fall out of my hands, out of my heart
And when you hit the ground
You'll be sorry that I'm not around
I will watch you while you
Fall out of your mind, out of your fantasy
When you hit the wall, think of me (Vanessa: Think of me, yeah)
I'll be on the top just watching you

Fall out of my hands, out of my heart
And when you hit the ground
You'll be sorry that I'm not around
I will watch you while you
Fall out of your mind, out of your fantasy
When you hit the wall, think of me

Vanessa:
I'll be on the top just watching you fall
