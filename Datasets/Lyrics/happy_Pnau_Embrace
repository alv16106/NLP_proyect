On a night like tonight
You saved my life
Red and green
Wet shoes slip on refracted lights

Running faster than my legs can take me
Shouting louder than my lungs allow me

Why, as the rivers run
Still got time for someone
Be my embrace now
Be my embrace now
(x 2)

Light a match,
Bring the flame over to your eye
Slipping past, you won't see me before you die
Breaking down our sleep, my head's still aching
This war is killing you and all around me

Why, as the rivers run
Still got time for someone
Be my embrace now
Be my embrace now
(x 2)

You go, go, go, go
(x 4)

Why, as the rivers run
Still got time for someone
Be my embrace now
Be my embrace now
(x 4)
