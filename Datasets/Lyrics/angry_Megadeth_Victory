Now, one day I started telling everyone
That killing is my business, and I was hung like a martyr
For looking down the cross, my skull beneath the skin
Prophesized last rites, loved to death, my friends
Then I started seeing bad omens in my head
Good mourning, Black Friday, will I wake up dead?
If I ain't superstitious, then this won't mean a thing
But some crazy shit has happened since the conjuring

Not even close
Not even close
Not even close
To overdose

Had fingers in my eyes
Had needles in my veins
A knife right through my heart
I am a victory
Had fingers in my eyes
Had needles in my veins
A knife right through my heart
I am a victory

Came anarchy to set the world afire
Pain of hook in mouth, In my darkest hour
Corruption of the world, peace sells, but nobody's buying
Ignorant religion, holy wars and dying, yeah
Tornado nearly got me by the skin o' my teeth
This was my life, foreclosure of my dreams
May the past rust in peace in Hangar 18
And countdown to extinction just be a bad dream

Hahaha
Not even close
Not even close
Not even close
To overdose

Had fingers in my eyes
Had needles in my veins
A knife right through my heart
I am a victory
Had fingers in my eyes
Had needles in my veins
A knife right through my heart
I am a victory

Hah, not even close
Not even close
Not even close
To overdose

Had fingers in my eyes
Had needles in my veins
A knife right through my heart
I am a victory
Had fingers in my ey-ey-eyes
Had needles in my veins
A knife right through my heart
I am a victory
Had fingers in my eyes
Had needles in my veins
A knife right through my heart
I am a victory
Had fingers in my eyes
Had needles in my veins
A knife right through my heart
I am a victory
