What happened to us all
Have we slept through it?
Taking hits off the surface (surface)
It's too hard to swallow it
The judgement to concentrating
On everything they know.

(Was it all or none (nothing) or did he wake you up from your sleeping?)

I've overheard it once
This has gone on before
It's still one in the same
(When are accounted for)
We seem so far away from
These things we used to know
We seem so far away from everything


Everyone that moves around me
They're saying something
That makes the fire glow
Savor something that no one wanted to hear
They know that everything wrong

(Was it all or none (nothing) or did he wake you up from your sleeping?)

I've overheard it once
This has gone on before
It's still one in the same
(When are accounted for)
We seem so far away from
These things we used to know
We seem so far away from everything

All we are is golden (golden)
This won't mean a thing
All we know is golden (golden)
This won't mean a thing
