All the clever things I should say to you
They got stuck somewhere, stuck between me and you
Oh, I'm nervous, I don't know what to do
Light a cigarette only smoke when I'm with you, oh
What the hell do I do that for? You're just another guy
Okay, you're kinda sexy but you're not really special

But I won't mind if you take me home, come on take me home
I won't mind if you take off all your clothes, come on take 'em off
'Cause I like you so much better when you're naked
I like me so much better when you're naked
I like you so much better when you're naked
I like me so much better when you're naked
