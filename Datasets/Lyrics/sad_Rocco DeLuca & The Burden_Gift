I don't want to be
Political energy
A constant apology
Or an instrument of hurt
A hammer coming down
To pound and pound and pound
The door to your closet
Is greedy with love

Here's my gift to you
Accept it accept it
That's all you have to do
Accept it accept it

Confused, the twilight sings
It looks like diamond rings
The jewels that this hour brings


Throw shadows in the park
Don't wanna waste your time
Or take what isn't mine
Don't fix me 'cause I'm broken
I was that way from the start

Here's my gift to you
Accept it accept it
That's all you have to do
Accept it

Here's my gift to you
Accept it accept it
That's all you have to do
Accept it accept it
