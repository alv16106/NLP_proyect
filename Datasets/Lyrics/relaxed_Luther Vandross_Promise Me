Promise me
Luther Vandross
(Album: Forever, For Always, For Love - 1982)

I can only speak for
The things that I've been through
So when it comes to our love
I'll talk the whole night through
About the lovin' I've been missin'
Lately, baby I ain't had no kissin'
Don't you love me
Can we stay together

Like when we used to be in love
But now you've got your head on another cloud
Girl, we had a good thing
But now you've turned around
Don't you even care how this love
We've had turns out

(Promise me, you'll leave me never)
(That we'll be in love forever)
(Promise me, you'll leave me never)
(And that we'll be in love forever)

We can work at our love
And make it all brand-new
If we stay together
There's nothing we can't do
Improve the lovin' is what I'm seeing
Let's do it baby
Don't fight the feeling
Won't you love me
Can we stay together

Repeat Bridge and Chorus

Forever, ever, promise me you'll leave me never
Won't you promise me (That you'll leave me never)
Promise me, forever and ever, and ever
