What are we supposed to do?
Living in a time like this?
What's the flipping do?

So many people flipping their lids

Keep taking the children to the park
Don't let them break your poor little heart
Don't let no one get you down
'Cause your storm don't bring no calm
You will be living in raging force
You'll be sorry the day you were born
When they castrate your arm. you know?

Man and woman we have to talk
Even if you don't like world war
Even if it makes you mad and we ball
Sometimes it's lack of understanding
And me and you can manage
Before we break down and damage

Our heart, our heart, and soul. Our body, our heart, and soul...

Don't flip your lids... don't lose it... don't flip your lids... don't lose it... don't flip your lids
