Images of perfection, suntan and napalm. Grenada, Haiti, Poland, Nicaragua
Who shall we choose for our morality? I'm thinking right now of Hollywood tragedy

Your idols speak so much of the abyss, yet your morals only run as deep as the surface

Cool, groovy, morning, fine, Tipper Gore was a friend of mine
I love a free country, the stars and stripes and an apple for Mommy

(Conservative say) There ain't no black in the union jack
