I'm heavy-handed, to say the least
My mother thinks I'll be an awful clutcher
'Cause I spill things from stirring 'em too quickly
I'm far too loud
It's like as soon as I've got an opinion, it just has to come out
I laugh at stupid things just 'cause they tickle me

And, sometimes I wish, sometimes I wish I was like Mariella
She got some Pritt Stick and she glued her lips together
So she never had to speak, never had to speak, never had to speak
People used to say she's as quiet as a mouse, she just doesn't make a peep

She marched to her wardrobe and she threw away the colour
Because wearing black looks mysterious, but it didn't impress her mother
She wanted to dress her baby in patterns and flowers
But Mariella just crossed her arms and so she cried for hours

Mariella
Mariella
My pretty, baby girl
Unglue your lips from being together and wear some pink and pearls

You can have your friends 'round and they can stay for tea
Won't you just try to fit in please? Do this for me
But Mariella just crossed her arms and she walked up the stairs
And she went into her bedroom and she sat on her bed
And she looked in the mirror and she thought to herself
If I want to play, I can play with me,
If I want to think, I'll think in my head.

At school, Mariella didn't have many friends
Yeah, the girls, they all looked at her and they thought she was quite strange
And the boys are not really into girls that age
And the teachers, they thought Mariella was just going through a phase
But Mariella just smiled as she skipped down the road
Because she knew all the secrets in her world
Yeah, she always got the crossword puzzles right every day
And she could do the alphabet backwards, without making any mistakes

Mariella
Mariella
You pretty, pretty girl
Mariella
Mariella
Happy in your own little world
Happy in her own little world

And she said "I'm never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever
Yeah, I'm never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever
Yeah, I'm never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever
Gonna unglue my lips from being together"

She said "I'm never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever
Yeah, I'm never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever
Gonna unglue my lips from being together, ha ha ha ha"
