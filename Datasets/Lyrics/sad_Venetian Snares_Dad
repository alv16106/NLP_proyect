I had a dream you were still alive
Playing Mozart records in the basement
And you whistled like you always did
When it hit your favorite part

I had a dream you were still alive
Like I could feel your stubble on my face
When you kissed me goodnight
And we'd do our special signal together

I had a dream you were still alive x2
Wearing a brown black shirt x 6
