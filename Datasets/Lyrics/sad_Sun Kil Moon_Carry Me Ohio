Sorry that
I could never love you back
I could never care enough
In these last days

Her tears fell
On her pages found me well
On her words I don't know what
To do or say

Wading through
Warm canals and pools clear blue
Tuscarawas flows into
The Great Lake

Right in back
Where the highway met dead-end tracks
The ground is now cement and glass
So far away

Heal her soul
Carry her, my angel
Ohio

Green, green youth
What about the sweetness we knew?
What about what's good, what's true
From those days?

Can't count to
All the lovers I've burned through
So why do I still burn for you?
I can't say

Sorry that
I could never love you back
I could never care enough
In these last days

Heal her soul
Carry her, my angel
Ohio

Children blessed
Gather round the home she rests
So poor and cold in their Midwest
Moon and sun

Flashes bringing on
My open eyes to lightning storm
The touch of mist felt soft, felt warm
On my face

Graving dreams
A million miles ago, you seem
The star that I just don't see
Anymore

Words long gone
Lost on journeys we walked on
Lost are voices heard along
The way

Sorry for
Never going by your door
Never feeling love like that
Anymore

Heal her soul
Carry her, my angel
Ohio
