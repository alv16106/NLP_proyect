I'm bored, you're boarding the 504 out of town 
It's late, so look straight,
Don't pull your eyes off the ground 
You sit and wait across the gate 
The minutes stretch themselves so long 
You'll never be my destiny 
Because my destination's wrong 

Right coast, left coast 
Drifting round and round 
I'm lost, always 
And I know I can't be found 

Who made these customs I can't seem to get past? 
It's no use, since you've been born
Into a higher class 
When I want you, and only you
Somehow your baggage comes along 
And it never stops, no, it never stops
Until I'm back where I belong 

Right coast, wrong coast 
Drifting round and round 
I'm lost, always 
And I know I can't be found

You can't see me 
Across this great divide 
I'm lost, always 
If I'm not right by your side 

Back where I belong
Back where I belong 
Back where I belong 
Back where I belong 

Back where I belong 
Back where I belong 
Back where I belong 
Back where I belong
