There's a place I dream about
Where the sun never goes out
And the sky is deep and blue
Won't you take me there with you?

We can begin again
Shed our skin, let the sun shine in
At the edge of the ocean
We can start over again

Sha la la la la la la, sha la la, sha la la
Sha la la la la la la, sha la la, sha la la

There's a world I've always known
Somewhere far away from home
When I close my eyes I see
All the space and mystery

We can begin again
Shed our skin, let the sun shine in
At the edge of the ocean
We can start over again

Sha la la la la la la, sha la la, sha la la
Sha la la la la la la, sha la la, sha la la

We can begin again
Shed our skin, let the sun shine in
At the edge of the ocean
We can start over again
At the edge of the ocean
We can start over again

Sha la la la la la la, sha la la, sha la la...
