Out of the mist into tropical splendour
With garlands of flowers
In Majestical fusion we see tonight
On to this sacred reunion of pleasure
They row as a rhythm, ten thousands of millions
They touch the Light
King is sailing they say
King is sailing we hear
King is sailing they say
King is sailing this day of days of days

(Printed lyrics show the following which is left out entirely in recording)
(Drums beating faster through harder excitement
(The wings bring the Angels
(They singing of Truth that this day has come
(
(Older than oldest religions have promised
(A promise is kept on this Golden Reflection
(His Kingdom Come
King is coming they sing
King is coming they know
King is coming we sing
King is coming we know Kotao Kotao Kotao
All the souls he to touch
All the souls he to touch
All the souls he to touch
All the millions of souls he to touch, he to touch
Cocasaya Kotao Kotao
Heaven set sail in His ship full of light
He trancends all our love
To caress all our fears
In a moment Divine
Weakest and Strongest will dance in delight
All illuminous our Saviour they bringing him forth
All will sing to the Night
Our true Kingdom come
Our true Kingdom come
Our true Kingdom come
Our true Kingdom come
Higher, Than Higher, Than Higher, Than Higher, Than Higher
Ahhs...
