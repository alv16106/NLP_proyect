The gap that grows between our lives, the gap our parents never had
Stop those thoughts control your mind, replace the things that you despise
Oh, you're old, I hear you say. It doesn't mean that I don't care
I don't believe in it anymore. Pathetic acts for a worthless cause

In the beginning when we were winning, when our smiles were genuine
In the beginning when we were winning, when our smiles were genuine
But now unforgiven, the everlasting, everlasting

The world is full of refugees. They're just like you just like me
But as people we have a choice to end the void with all its force
So don't forget or don't pretend, it's all the same now in the end
It was said in a different life. Destroys my days and haunts my nights

In the beginning when we were winning, when our smiles were genuine
In the beginning when we were winning, when our smiles were genuine
But now unforgiven, the everlasting, everlasting

In the beginning when we were winning, when our smiles were genuine
In the beginning when we were winning, when our smiles were genuine
But now unforgiven, the everlasting, everlasting
But now unforgiven, the everlasting, everlasting
