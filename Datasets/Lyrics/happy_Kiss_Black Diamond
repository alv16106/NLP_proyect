Out on the street for a living
Picture's only begun (wooh)
Got you under their thumb

Hit it !

Out on the streets for a living
Picture's only begun
Your day is sorrow and madness
Got you under their thumb

Wooh, black diamond
Wooh, black diamond

Darkness will fall on the city
It seems to follow you too (wooh)
And though you don't ask for pity
There's nothin' that you can do, no, no

Wooh, black diamond
Wooh, black diamond

Out on the streets for a living
Picture's only begun (wooh)
Your day is sorrow and madness
Got you under their thumb

Wooh, black diamond, yeah
Wooh, black diamond
