No time for wasting away

We're breaking up the city
No time for wasting away
So tell me why should we stay
A prisoner of today

We're breaking up the city
No time for wasting away
So tell me why should we stay
A prisoner of today (when there's no time for one another, no time for one another)

History I can't erase

Cause this is our time, this is our time
This is our time and our place
History I, history I
History I can't erase

We're breaking up the city
No time for wasting away
So tell me why should we stay

No time for wasting away
So tell me why should we stay
A prisoner of today

We're breaking up the city
No time for wasting away

We're breaking up the city
No time for wasting away

A prisoner of today (when there's no time for one another, no time for one another)

There's no time for one another
There's no time for one another
