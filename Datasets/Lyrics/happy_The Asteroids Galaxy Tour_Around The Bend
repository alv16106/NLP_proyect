Ooh, ooh, yeah!
Ooh, ooh, yeah!

Muck around
Waste another mile now
Muck around
Waste another mile now

You feel the need
There is no way to return
You feel the need
Oh yeah it burns

What a ride
Hot love on a platter
Yeah, yeah

Give me that thing
Give in my friend
Give me good, good times around the bend
I'll stay forever

Give me that thing
Give in my friend
Give me hot, hot love around the bend
I'll stay forever with you

Ooh, ooh, yeah!

Lay down on daddy's lawn
Lay me down
Smell the break of dawn

You feel the heat
There is no way to return
You feel the heat
Oh yeah it burns

Pick a fruit
Let me be your apple
Yeah, oh yeah!

Give me that thing
Give in my friend
Give me good, good times around the bend
I'll stay forever

Give me that thing
Give in my friend
Give me hot, hot love around the bend
I'll stay forever with you

Yeah-eah!
Ooh, ooh, yeah!
Yeah-eah!
Ooh, ooh, yeah!

Give me that thing
Give in my friend
Give me good, good times around the bend
I'll stay forever

Oh yeah!

Give me that thing
Give in my friend
Give me hot, hot love around the bend
I'll stay forever with you

Forever with you (Stay for ever)
Muck around 'til the end
I'll stay forever with you

Give me love
Give in, my friend
Ah, 'round the bend
Yeah, hot, hot love
