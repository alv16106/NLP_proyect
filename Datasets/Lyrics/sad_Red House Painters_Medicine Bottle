Giving in to love and sharing my time
Letting someone into my misery
I told it all step-by-step
How I landed on the island and how I'd swim across the sea
And it crosses my mind that I may awake to a knife in me

No more breath in my hair or ladies' underwear
Tossed up over the alarm clock
Blood dripping from the bed to a neatly written poem, a heartfelt last line reading:
"There is no more mystery". Is it going to happen, my love?
"There is no more mystery". Is it going to happen, my love?

"It's all in my head", she said, "Morning after nightmare
You're building a wall", she said, "Higher than the both of us
So try living life instead of hiding in the bedroom
Show me a smile and I'll promise not to leave you"

It happened under a rainy cloud, passing through the dark south
We went into a big house and slept in a small bed
I didn't know you then as well as you of me
We talked of our sad lives, and we went off separately
And we went off separately. I found your overseas souvenirs
Holiday greeting cards and some long-forgot high school fears

"It's all in my head", I said, banging a piano
"I've not been so alone", I thought, "Since kicking in the womb"
I drank so much tea, I wrote my letters in Kanji, yeah
Around the block I walked and walked, pretending you were with me

Not wanting to die out here
Without you

The hurting never ends, like birthdays and old friends
We forget that this flesh, blood and bone is human
Trading phone lines for airlines. Unwilling to face
That love is found on the inside, not the outside
And like a medicine bottle in the cabinet I'll keep you
And like a medicine bottle in my hand I will hold you

And swallow you slowly, as to last me a lifetime
Without holding too tight; I do not want to lose
The thrill that it gives me to look out from my window
And scowl at the houses from my world in the bedroom

"It's all in his head," she read in a girlfriend's self-help book
"It's all his own making; a war with himself
Like two sides of a wall that separates two countries
He shuts out the world and wants only to love you"

Not wanting to die out here
Without you
Not wanting to die out here
Without you
