Paralyzed by ancient delight
And riding for a fall today
I am dressed in style, so eager in mind
But furthermore distracted by you
And it's like I lose myself
In dreaming of summer days in bloom
Oh, I've got no clue how I could fight that
All that I am is worth a dime
Worth a dime


This liquid lunch will not stop my punch-
Drunk quality to doze while I run
It is thirty-nine degrees in my mind
It's thirty thousand miles more to go
'Cause it's like I lose myself
In dreaming of summer days in bloom
For I've got no clue whatever happened
All that I am is worth a dime
Worth a dime
