It was familiar to me,
The smoke too thick to breathe,
The tile floors glistened, 
I slowly stirred my drink.

And when you started to sing,
You spoke with broken speech
That I could not understand, 
And then you grabbed me tightly.

I won't let go, I won't let go.
Even if you say so, oh no.

I've tried and tried with no results.
I won't let go, I won't let go.

He then played every song from 1993.
The crowd applauded as he curtsied bashfully.
Your eyelashes tickle my neck
With every nervous blink,
And it was perfect
Until the telephone started 
Ringing ringing ringing ringing ringing off.
Ringing ringing ringing ringing ringing off.
Ringing ringing ringing ringing ringing off.
Ringing ringing ringing ringing ringing off.
Ringing ringing ringing ringing ringing off.
Ringing ringing ringing ringing ringing off.
Ringing ringing ringing ringing ringing off.
