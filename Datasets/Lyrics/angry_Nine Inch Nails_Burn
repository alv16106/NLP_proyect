This world rejects me
This world threw me away
This world never gave me a chance
This world's gonna have to pay

I don't believe in your institutions
I did what you wanted me to
I'm like the cancer in your system
I've got a little surprise for you

Something inside of me has opened up its eyes
Why did you put it there? Did you not realize?
This thing inside of me, it screams the loudest sound
Sometimes I think I could
Burn
Burn

I look down there where you're standing
Flock of sheep out on display
With all your lies propped up around you
I can take it all away

Something inside of me has opened up its eyes
Why did you put it there? Did you not realize?
This thing inside of me, it screams the loudest sound
Sometimes I think I could
I'm gonna burn this whole world down
I'm gonna burn this whole world down

I never was a part of you (burn)
I never was a part of you (burn)
I never was a part of you (burn)
I never was a part of you (burn)

I never was a part of you (burn)
I never was a part of you (burn)
I never was a part of you (burn)
I never was a part of you (burn)

I am your savior (burn)
I am corruption (burn)
I am the angel (burn)
Of your destruction (burn)
I am perversion (burn)
Secret desire (burn)
I am your future (burn)
Swallowed up in fire
