It was 20 years ago today
Motorhead taught this band to play
At first they were so out of style
Now, they're guaranteed to raise your bile

May I introduce to you?
The band who drank 1000 beers
Sgt. Hetfield's Motorbreath Pub Band
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Sgt. Hetfield's Motorbreath Pub Band
Hope you will enjoy the show
Sgt. Hetfield's Motorbreath Pub Band
Thrash and let the metal flow

Sgt. Hetfield's Motor, Sgt. Hetfield's Motor
Sgt. Hetfield's Motorbreath Pub Band

It's wonderful to drink beer, It's certainly a swill
You're such a lovely audience
We'd like to play your Motorbreath
You'd love to [Incomprehensible] your

I don't really want to stop the show

The band who drank 1000 beers
Sgt. Hetfield's Motorbreath Pub Band
Bring more beer
