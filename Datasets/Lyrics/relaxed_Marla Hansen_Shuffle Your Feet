Did you hurt your hand again last night when you fell in the snow?

Shuffle shuffle shuffle shuffle your feet without looking down.

You know how to place your feet carefully on the ground.

Lighten up

Lighten up

Lighten up, you say lighten up

Lighten up

But here it's dangerous, not like home.

You never know what might be under the snow.

Lighten up

Lighten up

Lighten up, you say lighten up

Lighten up

Tomorrow when we walk in the cold, keep hold your hand 'cause you know I like it so when.

If you push me down I will try not to care about what might me under there

Lighten up

Lighten up

Lighten up, you know, lighten up

Lighten up
