Sweat drips in my eyes
Screams of lust we cry
Tonight you are everything
You're everything...
You're everything to me no more
As I wake from this perfect dream
I'll escape from Eden's walls
Can I not stay and live this lie?
Go away and I'll think only of myself

And to think that you would not be scared or surprised if I'd severed all these ties
This is the end...

I'll lose myself in anguish for tonight
Help me get over you

I feel so numb to see this bitter end of beautiful illusions... would this be the same?
Broken pieces will not mend to save our past now... go away...

I'll lose myself in anguish for tonight
Help me get over you
One last false apology
Help me get over you

Now we must let go
Urgency overwhelms me as I must restrain my flood of tears
I refuse to be slave to your false beauty again

I'll lose myself in anguish for tonight
Help me get over you
One last false apology
Help me get over you

In my mind Blood drips from your eyes
A beautiful last goodbye
