God am I the only sane one around here
Doesn't anybody else find this queer
Oh shit oh
A wizard approaches
A reward for the weirdo
Party weirdo...
Countless times you have fallen weird one
I'm gonna ask the judge for a party crack down
A weirdo wack down hangin' out on streets in cars in bars
Outside my window in my pool in my bed in my head
Party weirdo... I'm simply ask the judge... hello hello...
Oh but somehow someway somewhere you get back on your partied
Out feet, hello hello, party weirdo...
It's just so exotic you got no where left to go, Party weirdo
You will ask yourself who am I what am I where am I
You will answer I am no one probably nothing
I know that I'm nowhere you poor crass animal ok I'm new around town
Can anybody tell me what all these party weirdos are all about
Someone says you must go there and check out the party weirdos
Now all I see is a lot of young people all mixed up
It's just not fair countless times you have fallen weird one partied out yet
You might expect one's weirdness to subside
But it does not subside it sort of grows and grows and grows man
You can just go find somewhere else to go 'cause you're just not welcome here any more
