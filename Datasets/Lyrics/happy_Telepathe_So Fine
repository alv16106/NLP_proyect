Pusher be the test and I beat to the rest
In my head, in my head now
Slow candle burning with your flame on high and now I'm dry land so
Play it bland, play it bland
The sound of escape now honey
Take it take it
Say it lover, say it lover right
It's all the faker, the light hearted taker
So take it, so take it, so take it

Dream is in this heart
Season in these years
Death is in this heart

So what so what
So fine so fine
So what so what
Be mine be mine

Burn it to the ground
