Raise me up, don't let me fall
'Cause I don't get myself
I feel like I felt before
But cannot find my way

All those feelings went away
I may not be what you think I am
Think we ought to find ourselves
Think we ought to find ourselves again

Raise me up, don't let me fall
'Cause it's getting so hard ('cause it's getting so hard)
I feel like I felt before
Maybe I only try? (maybe I only try?)

All those feelings went away
I may not be what you think I am
Think we ought to find ourselves
Think we ought to find ourselves again
All those questions never asked
All those days are coming back to me now
Dreams that can't be realized
All those nights are coming back to me now
And I know they're coming back
Coming back to you

All those questions never asked
Are coming back to me now
Dreams that can't be realized
Are coming back to me now

Raise me up
Raise me up, don't let me fall [x8]
