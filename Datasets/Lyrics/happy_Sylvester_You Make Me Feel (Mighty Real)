When we're out there dancin' on the floor darlin'
And I feel like I need some more and I
Feel your body close to mine and I
Know my love it's about that time
Make me feel mighty real
Make me feel mighty real

You make me feel mighty real
You make me feel mighty real

When we get home darlin' and it's
Nice and dark and the music's in me and I am
Still real hot and you kiss me fast and it
Feels real good and I know you love me
Like you should

Oh
You make me feel mighty real
You make me feel mighty real

Make me feel mighty real
Make me feel mighty real
Make me feel mighty real
Make me feel mighty real

I feel real
I feel real
I feel real
I feel real

Real real
I feel real
I feel real
I feel real

Woooh

<Instrumental interlude>

I feel real
I feel real
I feel real
I feel real

Real real
I'm real real
I feel real
I feel real

Woooh
I feel real
Woooh
I feel real

I feel real
I feel real
I feel real
I'm real real

You make me feel mighty real
You make me feel mighty real
Ah, you make me feel mighty real
You make me feel mighty real

Oh, I feel real
When you touch me
I feel real
When you kiss me
I feel real
When you touch me
I feel real
When you hold me

Real
Real
Real <fading out>
