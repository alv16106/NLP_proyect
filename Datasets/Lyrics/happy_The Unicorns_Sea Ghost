I dove into that freezing sea
With the parasite attached to me
I had hoped the salt below
Would divorce what was wed above

But league after league, it yet remained
For the fleshy vessel I kept it sustained

And so we froze a while surrounded by one big tear
Which only reminded me of a former home

But we weren't welcome, the sea made that clear
By filling us with saline and sending us blue blue back into the atmosphere
You choked as you surfaced, tangled in seaweed

But what remained of the driving intent?
That led me to tract such watery depths
Many things have betrayed me
Between there and here
And my memory is so fucking unclear

Who was I with? What time was it?
And where, who was I with? What time was it?
And where, where did you go?
