You're wrong every time

What makes you think you've got a god given right
For killing people in a needless fight
You're like a rapist with a target in sight
Democracy!

Whoever told you that you were bright
The skull and bones the conservative right
You're like a plague turning day into night
Atrocity!

What makes you think that you could start this mess
Then crawl away to a world you detest
You're fucking evil but you couldn't care less
Conspiracy!

What makes you think that we could ever believe
A major liar with a minor in greed
You make a profit off the people in need
Hypocrisy!

You're time is coming and it won't be long
The bill of rights is now the bill of wrong
Already proven that you don't belong
In History!

Your time is over-you'll be out on the street
What do you say to the people you meet
I saved the world because I didn't repeat
My policy
