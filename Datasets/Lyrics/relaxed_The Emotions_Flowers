We hold the key
To the world's destiny

Have you the feeling to shine your light
Usin' the power, shinin' bright
Years we've been searchin', born to be

All the good thing, good things, we're able to see
Your heart's afire, create for you
Love and desire, hearts of two

Think it over (yeah)
Life ain't a four leaf clover, (no, it ain't)
Think it over (brother)
Life ain't a four leaf clover

Love is a flower, from that a bud
To spread its sunshine and make us love
Beautiful colors shinin' through
Bless you, brother, God is watching you, He is watching you

Think it over
Life ain't a four leaf clover (no no no no no no no)
Think it over (you better)
Life ain't a four leaf clover

Love is a flower, let it shine on through
All you know where it's comin' from, God is watchin' you, oh, yes, He is
Listen, this is the time
Let that flower bloom all over you, you, you, you

We hold the key (brothers) to the world's (come together and love) destiny
(You see, it's like a flower sent from above)
We (let that flower bloom) hold the key (all over you and me)
To the world's (all over the world) destiny
(Do you know what I mean)
