(That sounds so nice)

She did somethin' for me one time
The gesture was sweet
Said "I'm doin' this for you, darlin'
Don't leave it on the street
With all those people
Don't you know anything?"

Drinkin' steadily into the night
Doin' a sailor's dance
Far below the clock towers height
I fell into her hands
She said, "I've got perfect virgin's feet
So come rest your head"

Recall the dyin' emperor
Is that all we can remember?
We gotta have animal fat
The stone-age knife is blunt and bloody
I thought you were a quicker study still
We gotta have animal fat

My ancestors built society by conquering the sea (the sea, the sea)
Can't explain the source of sour poise (?) comin' on through me
The western people
They don't know anything

Recall the dyin' emporer
Is that all we can remember?
We gotta have animal fat
The stone-age knife is blunt and bloody
I thought you were a quicker study still
We gotta have animal fat
Animal fat
Animal fat
