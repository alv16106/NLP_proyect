Lard
You can see it in the clouds up in the sky
Lard
Floats by in clusters in our water supply
Lard
It's all of us, man in our pores and in our hair
Lard's
What we conceal with these corny clothes we wear

Lard is all
Lard is divine
Lard is control
Lard whips and chains our soul

(Lard) We carry credit cards
(Lard) We live in fear of art

Lard is the OM
Lard is revolution
Lard is the tapeworm
In the bottle of cheap tequila
That comes alive at night
And sneaks up and bites your nipple

Lard
Lard

Nowadays, most of us need someone to run our personal life
Someone to see that the plants are watered
Someone to make sure the place is clean
Someone to make sure dinner is waiting
Someone to call for theater tickets
Someone to make up those cheap excuses

What we need is
Lard
Lard

The answer, the dancer, the ointment, the dream
Absorb it, inflame it, respect it, molest it

Lard
Lard

The country right now just wants to be soothed
And told it doesn't have to pay or sacrifice or learn
No one is over the hill when the mountain comes to Mohammed
Lard, Lard, Lard

We love to eat
We love to pray
Mold over mind
Hooray

The power of Lard
The power of Lard
The power of Lard
The power of Lard

Every time I take a crap, it's a cosmic experience
Religion and chemicals are the key to the future
Next time we have sex, just pretend that I'm Ed Meese
The weasels have it down, man; it's a whole new age

Lard

Which would you prefer, a computer or a gun
The sharks out lived the dinosaurs, you know

The power of Lard
The power of Lard
The power of Lard
The power of Lard

Pity the poor trainer in the stable when the race horse farts
Poison oak really is the aphrodisiac of the Gods
When people are asleep, we must all become alarm clocks
Hey, man, life is my college
Yeah

It's dental floss of the mind
Who will babysit the babysitters?

Ever hear about that guy in New York 
Whose dick fell off in the bath after he shot it full of coke
It's okay to run out of butter in Zambia
Just smear squashed caterpillars on your toast
Waiter, there's a terrorist in my soup
Which came first, Max Headroom or Gerald Ford
Are you a man or are you a mouse?
If you love your fun, die for it
Die for it

The Power of Lard
The Power of Lard
The Power of Lard
The Power of Lard

Who's gonna babysit the babysitters?
Who's gonna babysit the babysitters?
Who's gonna babysit the babysitters?
Who's gonna babysit the babysitters?

Avoid everything

Everything, everything
Everything, everything
Everything, everything
Everything, everything
