Album version

You had all of them on your side
Didn't you? Didn't you?
You believed in all your lies
Didn't you? Didn't you?

(The ruiner's got a lot to prove he's got nothing to lose and now he made you believe
The ruiner's your only friend well he's the living end to the cattle he deceives
The raping of the innocent you know the ruiner ruins everything he sees
Now the only pure thing left in my fucking world is wearing your disease)

How did you get so big?
How did you get so strong?
How did you get so hard?
How did it get so long?

You had to give them all a sign
Didn't you? Didn't you?
You had to covet what was mine
Didn't you? Didn't you?

(The ruiner's a collector he's an infecter serving his shit to his flies
Maybe there will come a day when those that you keep blind will suddenly realize
Maybe it's a part of me you took it to a place I hoped it would never go
And maybe that fucked me up much more than you'll ever know)

How did you get so big?
How did you get so strong?
How did you get so hard?
How did it get so long?

What you gave to me
My perfect ring of scars
You know I can see
What you really are

You didn't hurt me, nothing can hurt me
You didn't hurt me, nothing can stop me now
You didn't hurt me, nothing can hurt me
You didn't hurt me, nothing can stop me now
You didn't hurt me, nothing can hurt me
You didn't hurt me, nothing can stop me now
You didn't hurt me, nothing can hurt me
You didn't hurt me, nothing can stop me now
You didn't hurt me, nothing can hurt me
You didn't hurt me, nothing can stop me now
You didn't hurt me, nothing can hurt me
You didn't hurt me, nothing can stop me now

You had to give them all a sign, didn't you?
You had to covet what was mine, didn't you?
The Ruiner's a collector, he's an infector serving his shit to his flies
Maybe there will come a day where those that
You keep blind will suddenly realize
Maybe it's a part of me you took it to a place
I hoped it would never go
And maybe that fucked me up much more than
You'll ever know

How did you get so big?
How did you get so strong?
How did you get so hard?
How did it get so long?

You had all of them on your side, didn't you?
You believed in all your lies, didn't you?
The Ruiner's got a lot to prove
He's got nothing to lose and now he made you believe
The Ruiner's your only friend
He's the living end to the cattle he deceives
Raping of the innocent, you know the Ruiner ruins everything he sees
Now the only pure thing left in my fucking world is wearing your disease

How did you get so big?
How did you get so strong?
How did you get so hard?
How did it get so long?

What you gave to me
My perfect ring of scars
You know I can see
What you really are

Nothing can stop me now
