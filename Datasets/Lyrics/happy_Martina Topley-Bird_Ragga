Someone wanna come around
Dumpin' fun around
I bring my bat around
And pop one in your shoulder

And pop one in your shoulder

I'll be the same
I'll be the same

...A pacifist (?)
Cruising on my list (?)
Feeling...

I come as fast as this
Like a Viper Kiss
Tricky make a vapour
Make you get your cold on

Wrap my tongue around
You get to be the clown
I come like underground
I make you feel older

I like it so much
I'm doing things I wouldn't normally do
And when it comes to your touch
I'm doing things I wouldn't normally do

I wrap my tongue around
You get to be the clown
I come like underground
I make you feel older

I wrap my tongue around
You get to be the clown

I like it so much
I'm doing things I wouldn't normally do
And when it comes to your touch
I'm doing things I wouldn't normally do

I like it so much
I'm doing things I wouldn't normally do
When it comes to your touch
I'm doing things I wouldn't normally do

Someone wanna come around
Dumping fun around
I bring my bat around
And pop one in your shoulder

Someone wanna come around
Dumping fun around
I bring my bat around
And pop one in your shoulder

And pop one in your shoulder
And pop one in your shoulder

I love it so much
I'm doing things I wouldn't normally do
And when it comes to your touch
I'm doing things I wouldn't normally do

I like it so much
I'm doing things I wouldn't normally do
When it comes to your touch
I'm doing things I wouldn't normally do

I like it so much
I'm doing things I wouldn't normally do
When it comes to your touch
I'm doing things I wouldn't normally do
