Morning calls, darkness draws
Upon this day a shadow falls
Silence walks through the halls
Since I've been gone, gone, gone

A hundred years from today
Lamplight blaze paves my way
Till Jesus saves my early grave
I will be gone, gone, gone

Drop the anchor, lift my heart
From stem to stern I'm torn apart
Mount my horse, pack my cart
Tomorrow I'm gone, gone, gone

Seek the hull, leave the deck
Silver moon, silhouette
In due time you will forget
That I am gone, gone, gone

Since I've been gone (gone), gone (gone), gone (gone)
I will be gone (gone), gone (gone), gone (gone)
Tomorrow I'm gone (gone), gone (gone), gone (gone)
