The tide is high
I've never been so low
You got room to grow

You can never look up
You can't ever look down
You get kicked around

But I built it with sand
And I built it with rock
I built it with all of the
Things that I'm not
And I watch from the hill
As it burns to the ground
I can still see the smoke
From my train out of town

Everything I build is breaking down
Everything I build is breaking down

I close my eyes
Scared of what I saw
Are you mad at all?
Been an open book
Been a slamming door
Apple of the trojan war

Everything I build is breaking down
Everything I build is breaking down

Drink a little bit
Dance a little bit
Take a chance
I lose it all
I have no remorse no regrets
When I'm hanging from
This seventeenth floor

The tide is high
Never been so low
You got room to grow

Everything I build is breaking down
Everything I build is breaking down
