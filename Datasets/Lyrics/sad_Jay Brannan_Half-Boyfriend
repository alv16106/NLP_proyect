I don't know where we're going
But I know we've gone too far and
I hope it isn't showing
But I think I love you and
I can't believe you're leaving
Just when I let you in and
When you had me believing
I could feel again

I could give a million reasons
Why we should not be friends
Our moods change like the seasons
My mood ends your mood begins and

You're a tease, you're a cockblocker
You're a loud mouth bitch, and a big talker,
But that's okay.
You'll grow up someday.

You're the pill I never wanted to take.
An anti-misanthrope
Mine was the heart I never thought you would break
My one hope was that I'd survive you

I've shown up for you
In ways that boy never would, but
I know you'll go back to him and
Maybe you should, but
I hope you don't go backwards
'Cause I'm going on ahead and
One day you'll wish that you had
Stuck with me instead

As I wander through Union Square
I remember when you followed me there
You were the stalker I kinda wanted to have
Being your half-boyfriend was only half bad
