In narrow streets that climb away
From harbour walls at close of day
As dusk falls soft I hear
My footsteps echo clear
Across the bay
Up into the starry blue

Rain and tears streaming down my face
Dark chill of this empty place
The night bears witness to
All my heart can hold

I'm left watching all my thoughts collide
Wish I could take back such foolish pride
I felt you understood this love inside
Now it's just an arrow fallen wide
Of all my heart can hold

I realise here beneath this sky
I've never known how to say goodbye
So you just slipped away
From what I had to say
That still connects me to
All my heart can hold

I felt you understood this love inside
Now it's just an arrow fallen wide
Of all my heart can hold

Here in the midnight
Fading shadows reappear
Have I been dreaming for too long?
So many ghosts and fears
Are catching up with me
Don't make me wait too long
Don't make me wait too long

All around me the world is still
I lift my head on this lonely hill
I'll put these stars to flight
Roll back this velvet night
And make a million suns
Shine only on you

I'm left watching all my thoughts collide
Wish I could take back such foolish pride
I felt you understood this love inside
Now it's just an arrow fallen wide
Of all my heart can hold

All my heart can hold
...Can hold...
All my heart, all my heart can hold...
