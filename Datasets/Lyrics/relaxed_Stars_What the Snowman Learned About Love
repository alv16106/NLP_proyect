I am Evan and this is my heart
I am Amy and this is my heart
I am Chris, this is my heart
I am Torq, this is my heart

How the heart bends
And summer, she sends
A sky that refuses to die
With the weeds of the sea
That wrap 'round our knees
And a sun too hot to go down

You come around
You come around
You come around
You come around
You come around
You come around
You come around

How the heart bends
And summer, she sends
A sky that refuses to die
With the weeds of the sea
That wrap 'round our knees
And a sun too hot to go down

You come around
You come around
You come around
You come around
You come around
You come around
You come around

You come around
You come around
You come around
You come around
You come around
You come around
You come around
