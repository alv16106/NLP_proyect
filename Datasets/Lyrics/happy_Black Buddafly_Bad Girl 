Guess who (hey, hey)
F to the A-B (hey)
Black Buddafly, let's go
And I'm a bad boy, like Martin and Will
You what you been missin' like da kids on the carton of milk
Hey, I can snatch something bad outta the hood
And bring 'em back to the pad out by da woods
You know the crew bring the bad outta da good
And I'm usually not layin' in the boozy spots
Girl, we can blow quicker than oozi shots
Chill where da Cristal's cold jacuzzi's hot, ya feel?

(Black Buddafly:)
I ain't really the kinda girl that would
Say that I'm a bad girl, though I should
So many times I did whatever was right
But ended up in pain and that's why I'm like
I still believe and I'm hopin'
That I will find real love
But right now is not the time for that
'Cause I'm young and I'm bad, and I like that

Do you feel me now
Dance with me now
Ladies, help me out

Ay, if you feel me
Move wit me and don't stop
Put your hands up
Soon as the beat drops
'Cause usually, I'm like this but tonight
I'm a bad girl
I'm a bad girl
And tonight we gonna show you how we get down

Don't think I'm innocent
Might look like that outside but when
I be alone wit you, you'll see different
'Cause all those boys dig those crazy things
I like it so good and so deep
Like I said, put me straight to sleep
Don't get me wrong, because I'm not a hoe
I tell when to stop and where to go

Do you feel me now
Dance with me now
Ladies help me out, what

Ay, if you feel me
Move wit me and don't stop
Put your hands up
Soon as the beat drops
'Cause usually, I'm like this but tonight
I'm a bad girl
I'm a bad girl
And tonight we gonna show you how we get down

Ay, if you feel me
Move wit me and don't stop
Put your hands up
Soon as the beat drops
'Cause usually, I'm like this but tonight
I'm a bad girl
I'm a bad girl
And tonight we gonna show you how we get down

(Fabolous:)
Once a good girl gone bad, she's gone forever
Prolly with me, enjoying California weather
Hey Mami, we belong together
Like the white and yellow stones that set into the prom together
And now a girl get into a stressed out mood
And go bad faster than left out food
They say it's the lazy flow the shorties love
It drive 'em crazy, though, like Courtney Love
I keep a bad one that's also's a good cook
Fifth Ave. classy mixed with da hood look
And my good look them bad for yo health
And everybody know you can do bad by yourself, girl
