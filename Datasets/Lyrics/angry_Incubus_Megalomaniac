I hear you on the radio
You permeate my screen, it's unkind but
If I met you in a scissor fight
I'd cut off both your wings on principle alone
On principle alone

Hey megalomaniac
You're no Jesus
Yeah, you're no fucking Elvis
Wash your hands clean on yourself, baby and
Step down, step down, step down
Ooh

If I were your appendages
I'd hold open your eyes, so you would see
That all of us are heaven sent
(There was never meant to be only one)
And there was never meant to be only one
To be only one

Hey megalomaniac
You're no Jesus
Yeah, you're no fucking Elvis
Wash your hands clean on yourself, baby and
Step down, step down, step down
Step down
Step down
Oh, step down
Ooh

You're...
You're...
You're...

You're no Jesus
You're no Elvis
You're no Jesus

You're no Jesus
Say you're no Elvis
Say, you're no answer, ooh

Step down, step down
Step down, step down
Hey, hey

Hey megalomaniac
You're no Jesus
Yeah, you're no fucking Elvis
Wash your hands clean on yourself, baby and
Step down, step, step down

Step down
Oh, step down
Oh, step down
Step down
