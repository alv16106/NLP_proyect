So the Count of Monte Christo
Threw the cape over his head
And gave me a penny for my thoughts
But wouldn't get no change

Just old aged rhythmns
They were singing in his brain for
A mechanical crusade
Tried to shoot down his areoplane

But I see (I see), you see (you see)
Ain't no more honey from this bee
I see (I see), you see (you see)
I'm stung, you've got a hold on me
I see (I see), you see (you see)
Ain't no more honey from this bee
I see (I see), you see (you see)
I'm stung you've got a hold

You, I want to make you feel so special
It's time to break the ice
Bless you and your wicked ways
For I guess that these are strange days

But the tact must change
For the duchess to reveal her face
I'd give you all my pennies
For your gallantry at tomorrow's gate

When I see (I see), you see (you see)
Ain't no more honey from this bee
I see (I see), you see (you see)
I'm stung you've got a hold on me
I see (I see), you see (you see)
Ain't no more honey from this bee
I see (I see), you see (you see)
I'm stung you've got a hold

I see (I see), you see (you see)
Ain't no more honey from this bee
I see (I see), you see (you see)
I'm stung you've got a hold on me
I see (I see), you see (you see)
Ain't no more honey from this bee
I see (I see), you see (you see)
I'm stung you've got a hold

So the Count of Monte Christo
Threw the cape over his head
Gave me a penny for my thoughts
But wouldn't get no change

Just old aged rhythmns
They were singing in his brain for
A mechanical crusade
Tried to shoot down his areoplane

When I see (I see), you see (you see)
Ain't no more honey from this bee
I see (I see), you see (you see)
I'm stung you've got a hold on me
I see (I see), you see (you see)
Ain't no more honey from this bee
I see (I see), you see (you see)
I'm stung you've got a hold on me

I see (I see), you see (you see)
Ain't no more honey from this bee
I see (I see), you see (you see)
I'm stung you've got a hold on me
I see (I see), you see (you see)
