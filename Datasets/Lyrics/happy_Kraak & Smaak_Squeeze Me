But you make everything all right, when you hold and you squeeze me tight.
But you make everything all right, when you hold and you squeeze me tight.
But you make everything all right, when you hold and you squeeze me tight.
But you make everything all right, when you hold and you squeeze me tight.

You make me feel so nice, when I'm around with you
Wake up in the mornin' and I will spend my whole life with you
The sweetness of your smile helps away with all of my fears.

If it should all go wrong our lives'll come to tears
Iv never been so deep into anyone else but you
A place within my heart
Never been so close to you.
And if you want me to hang around then I'll never let go
Ill give you all my time, stick around with you for sure

But you make everything all right, when you hold and you squeeze me tight.
But you make everything all right, when you hold and you squeeze me tight.
But you make everything all right, when you hold and you squeeze me tight.
But you make everything all right, when you hold and you squeeze me tight.

If this should all come true, I'ma give my heart to you
To keep safe in your arms like I know that you want me to.
It gives me so much joy that I can call you all of mine
Oh will it all work out, we'll I see just give it time.
And if it all goes right looking down from a birds eye view,
I'll see my life made good from the time that I spent with you

I'll give you anything and everything will work out fine
So I can trust in you because you give me peace of mind.

Cause you are all I want, and you are all I need
Cause you are all I want...
Cause you are all I want, and you are all I need
'Cause you are all I want...

You take me by the hand, because I'm your only man, because I'm your only man, because I'm.

'Cause you make everything all right, when you hold and you squeeze me tight
'Cause you make everything all right, when you hold and you squeeze me tight
'Cause you make everything all right, when you hold and you squeeze me tight
'Cause you make everything all right, when you hold and you squeeze me tight
