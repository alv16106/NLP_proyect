I've been sleeping for forty days and
Yeah, I know I'm sleeping 'cause this dream's too amazing
She got gold doorknobs where her eyes used to be, yeah
One turn and I learned what it really means to see, yeah oh

Ah, it's the magical mystery kind
Ah, must be a lie
Bye bye to the too-good-to-be-true kind of love
Oh, I could die
Oh, now I could die

Now I've been sleeping for sixty days and
Nobody better pinch me, bitch I swear, go crazy
She got jumper cable lips, she got sunset on her breath
I inhaled just a little bit
Now I got no fear of death now, oh

Ah, it's the magical mystery kind
Ah, must be a lie
Bye bye to the too-good-to-be-true kind of love
Oh, I could die
Oh, now I could die

(Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my)
(Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my)
(Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my) I tell the truth
(Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my)

Ooh, ahh
Ooh, ahh
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Ooh, ahh
Ooh, ahh
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Ooh, ahh
Ooh, ahh
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah, yeah

Ah, it's the magical mystery kind
Ah, must be a lie
Bye bye to the too-good-to-be-true kind of love
Oh, I could die
Oh, now I could die
