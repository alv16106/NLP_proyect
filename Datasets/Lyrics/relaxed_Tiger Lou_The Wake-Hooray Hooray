Working keeps me sane I know
How many ships can one man row
Close my eyes drain for blood
Leaches brought the cleansing flood

Hooray, hooray

Patching up my broken bones
Filling jars with kidney stones
Losing weight do you wanna see
Cancer taking a crack at me

Hooray, hooray

Roses around two oak tree hearts
Burn me up and spread the parts
Lucky you there's cake and wine
First we mourn then we dine

Hooray, hooray
