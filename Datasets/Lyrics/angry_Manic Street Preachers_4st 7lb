I eat too much to die, and not enough to stay alive. I'm sitting in the middle, waiting.

Days since I last pissed; cheeks sunken and despaired. 
So gorgeous, sunk to six stone; lose my only remaining home 
See my third rib appear, a week later all my flesh disappears. 
Stretching taut, cling-film on bone; I'm getting better 

Karen says I've reached my target weight, 
Kate and Emma and Kristin know it's fake
Problem is "diet"'s not a big enough word

I wanna be so skinny that I rot from view

I want to walk in the snow and not leave a footprint
I want to walk in the snow and not soil its purity

Stomach collapsed at five; lift up my skirt my sex is gone. 
Naked and lovely and 5 st. 2; may I bud and never flower
My vision's getting blurred but I can see my ribs and I feel fine. 
My hands are trembling stalks and I can feel my breasts are shrinking

Mother tries to choke me with roast beef, and sits savouring her sole Ryvita
"That's the way you're built", my father said

But I can change; my cocoon shedding

I want to walk in the snow and not leave a footprint
I want to walk in the snow and not soil its purity

Kate and Kristin and Kit-Kat; all things I like looking at
Too weak to fuss, too weak to die. Choice is skeletal in everybody's life
I choose, my choice, I starve to frenzy. Hunger soon passes and sickness soon tires
Legs bent, stockinged, I am Twiggy. And I don't mind the horror that surrounds me
Self-worth scatters, self-esteem's a bore; I long since moved to a higher plateau
This discipline's so rare, so please applaud. Just look at the fat scum who pamper me so
Yeah 4 st. 7, an epilogue of youth. Such beautiful dignity in self-abuse
I've finally come to understand life through staring blankly at my navel
