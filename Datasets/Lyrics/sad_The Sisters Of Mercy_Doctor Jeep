Everybody shouts on I Love Lucy
Pee-wee reads the evening news
A preowned song or a secondhand Uzi
Everybody got a job to lose
Here come the golden oldies
Here come the Hezbollah
Businessmen from South Miami
Humming AOR

Meanwhile...

I like Cal and his dog Napalm
I like Ike and his itty-bitty A-bomb
Everybody got one, I want mine
You can order it up on Channel Nine

Meanwhile, in the Sheraton,
“Doctor Jeep” plays on and on and on

There was a time, but it's long gone
Janie got a crush on the Vietcong
Burning through downtown Saigon
Me, I'm sold—down the Mekong

Meanwhile, in the Sheraton,
“Doctor Jeep” plays on and on and on

Guns and cars and accidents
The threatened witness, my defense
You can sell one another for fifteen cents
Well, bye-bye, Mother, it's common sense

Meanwhile, in the Sheraton,
“Doctor Jeep” plays on and on and on

Everybody shouts on I Love Lucy
Pee-wee reads the evening news
A preowned song or a secondhand Uzi
Everybody got a job to lose
Here come the golden oldies
Here come the Hezbollah
Businessmen from South Miami
Humming AOR

Meanwhile, in the Sheraton,
“Doctor Jeep” plays on and on and on
