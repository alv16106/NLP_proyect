Tell me where I'm
Supposed to begin
An unhappy life working
Some kind of dead end job
For everything you thought you had
Has gone from worse to bad

Lean to the side
Whisper it quiet
The end is in sight to working
All night around the clock
For everything you thought you had
Has gone from worse to bad

But it's not my kind of scene oh yeah
Footprints on the other side
Remind me where I've been oh yeah
Ill watch from the other side

Tell me where I'm
Supposed to begin
Move out of sight and onto
Some life I'm dreaming of
For everything you thought you had
Has gone from worse to bad
So Ill just wait and watch the wheels
While you're turning back

But it's not my kind of scene oh yeah
Footprints on the other side
Remind me where I've been oh yeah
Ill watch from the other side

Pulls me over and it drags me under
Pulls me over and it drags me under
All right now all right now
