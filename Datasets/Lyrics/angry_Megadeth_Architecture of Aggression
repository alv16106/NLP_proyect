Born from the dark
In the black cloak of night
To envelop its prey below
Deliver to the light
To eliminate your enemy, hit them in their sleep
And when all is won and lost, the spoils of wars are yours to keep
Aw!

Great nations built from the bones of the dead with mud and straw
Blood and sweat, you know your worth
When your enemies praise your architecture of aggression
Praise your architecture of aggression

Hoo! Ensuing power vacuum
A toppled leader dies
His body fuels the power
Fire and the flames rise to the sky
One side of his face, a kiss, the other genocide
Time to pay
With your ass, a worldwide suicide

Great nations built from the bones of the dead with mud and straw
Blood and sweat, you know your worth
When your enemies praise your architecture of aggression

Born from the dark
In the black cloak of night
To envelop its prey below
Deliver to the light
To eliminate your enemy
Hit them in their sleep
And when all is won and lost, the spoils of war are yours to keep

Great nations built from the bones of the dead with mud and straw
Blood and sweat, you know your worth
When your enemies praise your architecture of aggression

Great nations built from the bones of the dead with mud and straw
Blood and sweat, you know your worth
When your enemies praise your architecture of aggression
