(One more day)
They said we'd be home for Christmas
	but I'm still here today
(One more day)
I went to see the first lieutenant
	he said shut up and wait

(One more day, no word)
(One more day, no word)

(One more day)
We don't pick no more trees till the union okay
(One more day)
If they don't get a contract soon
	then I don't think we can stay
One more day (no word)
One more day (no word)

All alone
All my friends are gone
Ears of stone, eyes gone blind
Too little to do and too much time

I haven't seen my girl in a year last July
She hasn't even written a letter but I try not to cry
One more day (no word)
One more day (no word)

All alone
All my friends are gone
Ears of stone, eyes gone blind
Too little to do and too much time

One more day (no word)
One more day (no word)
Ooh, one more day (no word)
Ooh, one more day (no word)
