Myth or legend
Nymph tale washed ashore
Near the kraken sleepeth stirs
Coral and bone

Infinite city
No sexy sneer
Hideous creation
Human and animal

Banter songs of rudeness to be adhered
Not on rocks that glisten
Harps to listen, comb hair
Tear right to pieces
Left to recess a watery grave

Sensing the blood of prey
Swimming in fear for life

Rolling over
Falling into jaws
Teeth that chatter
It distracts them all

The Fiji mermaid
She will let it know
Time is coming
To feed and gnaw

Rolling over
Falling into jaws
Teeth that chatter
It distracts them all

The Fiji mermaid
She will let it know
Time is coming
To feed and gnaw
