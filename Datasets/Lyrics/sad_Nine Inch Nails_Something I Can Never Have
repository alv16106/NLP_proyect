Album version

I still recall the taste of your tears
Echoing your voice just like the ringing in my ears
My favorite dreams of you still wash ashore
Scraping through my head till I don't wanna sleep anymore

You make this all go away
You make this all go away
I'm down to just one thing
And I'm starting to scare myself

You make this all go away
You make this all go away
I just want something
I just want something I can never have

You always were the one to show me how
Back then I couldn't do the things that I can do now
This thing is slowly taking me apart
Gray would be the color if I had a heart
Come on and tell me

You make this all go away
You make this all go away
I'm down to just one thing
And I'm starting to scare myself

You make this all go away
You make this all go away
I just want something
I just want something I can never have

In this place it seems like such a shame
Though it all looks different now, I know it's still the same
Everywhere I look you're all I see
Just a fading fucking reminder of who I used to be
Come on and tell me

You make this all go away
You make this all go away
I'm down to just one thing
And I'm starting to scare myself

You make this all go away
You make it all go way
I just want something
I just want something I can never have
I just want something I can never have

Still

I still recall the taste of your tears
Echoing your voice just like the ringing in my ears
My favorite dreams of you still wash ashore
Scraping through my head 'til I don't want to sleep anymore

You make this all go away
You make this all go away
I'm down to just one thing
I'm starting to scare myself
You make this all go away
You make it all go away
I just want something
I just want something I can never have

You always were the one to show me how
Back then I couldn't do the things that I can do now
This thing is slowly taking me apart
Grey would be the color if I had a heart
Come on tell me

You make this all go away
You make this all go away
I'm down to just one thing
I'm starting to scare myself
You make this all go away
You make it all go away
I just want something
I just want something I can never have

In this place it seems like such a shame
Though it all looks different now
I know it's still the same
Everywhere I look you're all I see
Just a fading fucking reminder of who I used to be
Come on tell me

You make this all go away
You make this all go away
I'm down to just one thing
I'm starting to scare myself
You make this all go away
You make this all go away
I just want something
I just want something I can never have
I just want something I can never have
I can never have
I can

Natural Born Killers

Let me tell you something; this is the 1990's. Alright?
In this day and age, a man has to have choices
A man has to have a little bit of variety

What are you talking about, variety? Hostages?
You want to fuck some other women, now?
Is that what you're talking about, Mickey?
Why'd you pick me up?
Why'd you take me out of my fucking house and kill my parents with me?
Ain't you committed to me?
Where are we fucking going?

Just relax, alright?
It's me, your lover
Not some demon, not your father
Alright, relax

No, you're not my fucking lover
You're not my fucking
You've been loving me?
You've been fucking loving me? Huh?
You've been loving me real...

I still recall the taste of your tears
Echoing your voice just like the ringing in my ears
My favorite dreams of you still wash ashore
Scraping through my head 'til I don't want to sleep anymore

You make this all go away, you make this all go away
I'm down to just one thing, I'm starting to scare myself
You make this all go away, you make this all go away
I just want something, I just want something I can never have
