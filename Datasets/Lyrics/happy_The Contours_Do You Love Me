You broke my heart
'Cause I couldn't dance
You didn't even want me around
And now I'm back to let you know
I can really shake 'em down

Do you love me? (I can really move)
Do you love me? (I'm in the groove)
Now do you love me (Do you love me?)
Now that I can dance? (Dance)

Watch me now (Work, work)
Oh, work it out, baby (Work, work)
Well, you're drivin' me crazy (Work, work)
With a little bit of soul now (Work)

I can mash potato (I can mash potato)
And do the twist (I can do the twist)
Now tell me, baby (Tell me, baby)
Do you like it like this? (Do you like it like this?)
Tell me (Tell me)
Tell me

Do you love me? (Do you love me?)
Now do you love me? (Do you love me?)
Now do you love me (Do you love me?)
Now that I can dance? (Dance)
Dance

Watch me now (Work, work)
Oh, shake it up, shake it (Work, work)
Oh, shake 'em, shake 'em down (Work, work)
Oh, little bit of soul now (Work)

(Work, work)
Oh, shake it, shake it, baby (Work, work)
Oh, you're driving me crazy (Work, work)
Oh, don't get lazy (Work)

I can mash potato (I can mash potato)
Do the twist (I can do the twist)
Well, now tell me, baby (Tell me, baby)
Do you like it like this? (Do you like it like this?)
Tell me (Tell me)
Tell me

Oh, do you love me? (Do you love me?)
Now do you love me? (Do you love me?)
Now do you love me? (Do you love me?)
(Now, now, now)

(Hey! Work, work)
Oh, work it out, baby (Work, work)
Well, you're driving me crazy (Work, work)
Oh, don't you get lazy (Work)

(Work, work)
Oh, hey, baby (Work, work)
Well, you're driving me crazy (Work, work)
