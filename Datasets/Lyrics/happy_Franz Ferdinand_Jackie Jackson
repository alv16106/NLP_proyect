Well, Jackie Jackson was a greedy boy
That's right, he liked to stuff his face
The thing that gave that boy the greatest joy
Was eating far too many cakes

And he ate one, two, three, four
But Jackie wanted more
Five, six, seven, eight, Jackie had another plate
And by the time he got to twenty
Anybody woulda thought that he'd had plenty

But he had another eight which
Which makes it twenty-eight
So when he got to twenty-eight
He stopped

He stopped eating cakes
But only because
He'd run out of cakes

But Jackie Jackson was a greedy boy
Yes, he said, "I've not had enough
I think that I could eat a thousand cakes
Then I could eat a thousand more"

"Because, because I love the taste of tasty cakes
I think I'll find myself some more"

And he did
He went down to the local shop
Where there were loads of cakes
Loads of cakes

So he ate one, two, three, four, five and six
Well, Jackie was a little bit sick
And didn't stop when he got to eight
And said, "I love the taste of cakes"

"I love the taste of cakes, that's right
I'll eat all day and I'll eat all night"
And one, two, three, four
Jackie had a little bit more

At seventeen he said, "I need to eat
Until the shop is clean
And cakes, and all the cakes
Pass through my mouth"

"I munch up a banana
I munched up cakes
Into my large expanding gut
My large expanding gut"

And he did, he ate thirty-two cakes in that shop and
Ah, he'd already eaten twenty-eight cakes
Twenty-eight and thirty-two, that means he'd eaten sixty cakes
And, well, do you think that
Jackie Jackson's had eaten enough cakes?

Well, Jackie was a greedy boy
He said, "I'll never have enough"
He ate ten, twenty, thirty, forty

Jackie said he'd never thought he'd get to eat
So many tasty cakes and ate another eighty
Jackie gave a little moan
His stomach gave a little groan

Jackie yelled and cried, "Oh, no
I think my belly's overloaded, my belly's overloaded
My belly's overloaded, my belly's overloaded
My belly's overloaded"
Bang

Jackie exploded
He'd eaten over two hundred
Two hundred, two hundred cakes
He'd eaten two hundred cakes and Jackie Jackson?

Well, Jackie was dead
