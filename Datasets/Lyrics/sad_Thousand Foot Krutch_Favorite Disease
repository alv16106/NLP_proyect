Wanting, watching, debating on which way to run to
Haunted, voices, craving someone to run to

I haven't lost myself in a long time,
I never tried to care when I wanted to,
I just want to be part of something,
I just want to be real like yo

Sometimes, I feel like a monster
And times, I feel like a saint
I'm on my knees, you're my favorite disease

Silent, warnings, tell me, that I've let things come undone
Show me, teach me the way to heaven, 'cause no other way can

I haven't lost myself in a long time,
I never tried to care when I wanted to,
I just wanted to be part of something,
I just wanted to be real like you

Sometimes, I feel like a monster
And times, I feel like a saint
I'm on my knees, you're my favorite disease

Closer, closer, closer to you
I need to be closer, have closure and get closer to you
Every step I take

Sometimes, I feel like a monster
And times, I feel like a saint
I'm on my knees, you're my favorite disease
And I love the way you kill me
Love the way you heal me

Sometimes, I feel like a monster
And times, I feel like a saint
I'm on my knees, you're my favorite disease
And I love the way you kill me
Love the way you heal me

I Love the way you kill me
Love the way you heal me
I love the way you kill me
Love the way you heal me
I love the way you kill me
Love the way you heal me
I love the way you kill me
Love the way you heal me
