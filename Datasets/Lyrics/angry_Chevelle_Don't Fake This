Ignoring a loss of sight
Afraid to blink, I might lose the sun
But don't make this out to be more than it isn't
Behind every lie, there's a burden within

Yes, you're my sight

This suffering
That's kept within
Disposable men
Lost

Inside
He was negative
This place
Once more was underground

So look and connect
We're refusing to rust
Healing has to begin
In the past

So don't fake this
Don't fake this
Don't fake this
Don't

This suffering
That's kept within
Disposable men
Lost

Don't fake this
Don't fake this
Don't fake this
Don't
Fake
Fake
Fake

This suffering
That's kept within
Disposable men
Lost
So don't fake this
Don't fake this
Don't fake this
Don't
Fake
Fake
Fake
