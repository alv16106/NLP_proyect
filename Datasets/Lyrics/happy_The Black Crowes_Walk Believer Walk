Go down, go down you stranger 
There's something waiting for you 
Angels, dolls and honey
Temples and harpoons

You want your main line Jesus 
Your want your diamond God
You want to pull the trigger
And kill the autumn home

So walk believer walk
Straight into the sun
Walk believer walk
Your work ain't ever done

Pray on, pray on my brother
Now's the time for truth
Black shadow come a-creeping
Take the soul right out of you

Can you feel the demons pulling?
Can you hear the devil sing?
Can you taste the poison in your mouth?
Feel the weight of his chains

So walk believer walk
Straight into the sun
Walk believer walk
Your work ain't ever done

Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Woah, ah, ah

Yeah, so walk believer walk
Straight into the sun
Walk believer walk
Your work ain't ever done

Yeah, walk believer walk
Straight into the sun
Yeah, walk believer walk
Your work ain't ever done

Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
