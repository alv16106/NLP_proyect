Yeah
I hear you
Now imma make you shut the fu-k up

They see me roving they want to stop, drop
Off the face of earth but imma make it pop hot
These niggas is not not
Watch me take my spot
Got money, got power and respect baby

I just hope times on my side
I've been tryin' all my life
Every block someone dyin'
Always high is our life

Come inside

Energys my ammunition
I got ak shells
So think about that when you plan on dissin
Go straight to to hell
Bred to be ballin
Since a baby kickin
I had to smell [sniff]
Brand new money
