Tainted, has our love grown cold
In a place that's bitter and broken
We tasted of a world unknown
Surely there must be something better something forever

Hello from the world below
I'm watching the sun burning
As the world is slowly turning I know that in letting go
I'm learning how to live through a life I have to give

Walking past the city lights
Silence can be so disturbing
You'll find me standing in the night
The stars never seemed so unending so unending

Hello from the world below
I'm watching the sun burning
As the world is slowly turning
I know that in letting go
I'm learning how to live through a life I have to give

We painted white-wash everything
When all that remains are shadows of the stains
Tell me where did we go wrong can we just move on

Hello from the world below
I'm watching the sun burning
As the world is slowly turning
I know that in letting go I'm learning how to live
Through a life I have to give

Hello to the world below
Watching the world spinning
This night seems so unending
I follow to a place I know
That's only the beginning start over after ending
