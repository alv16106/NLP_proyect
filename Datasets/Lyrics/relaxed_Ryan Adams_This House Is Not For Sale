Tell them that the house is not for sale. 
We're still livin' here, how come nobody can tell? 
They're taking all the furniture, movin' our things. 
Come on little honey, put your head on my knee. 
Tell them that the house is not for sale. 

And calm down, calm down, calm down
Calm down, calm down, calm down

Do you remember when we even bought this thing? 
I danced you across the wooden floor and then you signed the lease.
What happened in the car that night? What happened in the car that night? 
Tell them that the house is not for sale. 

Calm down, calm down, calm down
Calm down, calm down, calm down
Calm down

Tell them that the house is not for sale.
We could grab a couple sheets and give them quite a scare.
I remember lyin' on the bedroom floor, 
You were holding me honey, kissing my soul. 
Tell them that the house is not for sale. 

And calm down, calm down, calm down
Calm down, calm down, calm down
Calm down 
Calm down
