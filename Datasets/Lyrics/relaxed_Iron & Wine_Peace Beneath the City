Here's a prayer for the body buried by the interstate
Mother of a soldier, a tree in a forest up in flames
Black valley, peace beneath the city
Where the women hear the washboard rhythm in their bosom when they say

"Give me
Good legs
And a Japanese car
And show me a road."

Sing a song for the bodies buried by the riverbank
A well dressed boy and a pig with a bullet in the brain
Black valley, peace beneath the city
Where the white girls wander the strip mall, singing all day

"Give me
A juggernaut heart
And a Japanese car
And someone to free."

Say something for the body buried like a keepsake
Mother of a million mouths with the very same name
Black valley, peace beneath the city
Where the women tell the weather but never ever tell you what they pray

They pray, "Give me
A yellow brick road
And a Japanese car
And benevolent change."
