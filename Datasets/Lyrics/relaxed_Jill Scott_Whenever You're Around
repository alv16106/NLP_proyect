Hey
Mmmm hmmm,
Listen to me, listen to me, listen to me,
Listen to me
Listen to me, listen to me, listen to me, listen...

I've been talking to this man
He's been saying what I like and
He makes me smile,
When I'm down, so down

He says sweet things in my ear
All the things that I needed to hear
But that's as far as it's gone
I promise, I promise

But I enjoy it, I love it so
Cause it seems like I'm always alone
You're at arms reach
But baby,
Where are you?
Where are you?

'Cause I got this fire


Sweet and true
But I'm cold as ice around you

'Cause I'm lonely
Whenever you're around
'Cause I'm lonely
Whenever you're around

Whoa, whoa, whoa
What happened to the wonderful thing
We had
It seems like you're missing in action
And I'm tired, I'm tired
I'm tired, I'm tired, I'm tired, I'm tired

I don't wanna lose this good life
But I ain't scared
If I'm going to be the only one participating
In this
