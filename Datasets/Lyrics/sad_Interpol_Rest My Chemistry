I haven't slept for two days, I've bathed in nothing but sweat
And I've made hallways scenes for things to regret
My friends they come and the lines they go by
Tonight I'm gonna rest my chemistry
Tonight I'm gonna rest my chemistry

I live my life over cocaine, just some rage and three kinds of yes
And I've made stairways such scenes for things that I regret
Oh, those days in the sun, they bring a tear to my eye
Tonight I'm gonna rest my chemistry
Tonight I'm gonna rest my chemistry

But you're so young
You're so young, you look in my eyes
You're so young so sweet, so surprised

So the sign says okay, gotta take a ride
Just recline in the faraway, got to take some time to realize
That my friends they come and the lines they go by
Tonight I'm gonna rest my chemistry
Tonight I'm gonna rest my chemistry

But you're so young
You're so young, you look in my eyes
You look so young so sweet, so surprised
You look so young like a daisy in my lazy eye

So tonight I'm gonna rest my chemistry
Tonight I'm gonna rest my chemistry
Tonight I'm gonna rest my chemistry
Tonight I'm gonna rest my chemistry
