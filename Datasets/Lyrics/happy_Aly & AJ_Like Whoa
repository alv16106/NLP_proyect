Life is good, I can't complain
I mean I could, but no one's listening
Your image overwhelms my brain
And it feels good, good, good

Now I'm rollin' my window down
I love the wind but I hate the sound
You're like a tattoo that I can't remove
And it feels good
It feels good, it feels good

Like a roller coaster ride
Holdin' on, white knuckles like
Whoa, whoa
Can't believe I'm like
Whoa, whoa
Got me feelin' like
Up and down and side to side
Every inch of me is like
Whoa, whoa
Got me feelin' like
Whoa, whoa
Got me feelin' like

In the mornin' it begins again
Feels like I'm fallin' better strap me in
I think I'm running out of oxygen
And it feels good 
It feels good, it feels good (it feels good)

Like a roller coaster ride
Holdin' on white knuckles like
Whoa, whoa
Can't believe I'm like
Whoa, whoa

Got me feelin' like
Up and down and side to side
Every inch of me is like
Whoa, whoa
Got me feelin' like
Whoa, whoa
Got me feelin' like

My inhibitions are beginning to let go
This situation I can't help but lose control
You're an affliction that I cannot seem to break
It feels good, it feels good

I'm holdin' on
Holdin', holdin', holdin', holdin'
Holdin', holdin', holdin', holdin'
I'm holdin' on
Like a roller coaster ride
Like I'm running a red light
Like a rocket ship in flight
There's nothin' else that makes me feel like
Whoa

Like a roller coaster
Whoa
Holdin' on white knuckles
Whoa
Once you let your love in
Whoa
Every inch of me is like
Whoa, whoa-whoa, whoa
