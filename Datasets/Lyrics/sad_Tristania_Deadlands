I failed to impress you, and you
Feel free to abuse me
All has been in vain
We're through
So please stop pretending
Years I spent were wasted on you

Words have been spoken
My chains have been broken
This street has an end, I have failed
Never will again

My life was invaded by you
This image of straws that break against the wind
We're through
But the world keeps spinning
Endlessly

Weight off my shoulders
Unleashed
No more hiding
Leaving deadlands
Release me

Words have been spoken
My chains have been broken
This street has an end, I have failed
Never will again

On your own
Bitter and old
Dead and gone
Carved in stone

Words have been spoken
My chains have been broken
This street has an end, I have failed
Never will again
