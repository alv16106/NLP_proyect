I stab you right between the eyes
You awaken from the lies
I've said it ever since its inception
They're the masters of deception
I'm a godless heretic
Not a god-fearing lunatic
That's why it's become my obsession
To treat God like an infection

My scars insane, my life profane
I deny, defy 
And spread a little hate worldwide

Like a storm I devastate
Religious doubt I instigate
Take a listen to my confession
There's no filter on my aggression
With a blister open wide
To keep the massacre alive
I'll cause global devastation
With my moral imperfection

My scars insane, my life profane
I deny, defy
And spread a little hate worldwide

Religious doubt I instigate
From what the Bible demonstrates
Does it document creation?
Or just hopelessness of fiction?
I'm a godless heretic
Not a god-fearing lunatic
That's why it's become my obsession
To treat God like an infection

My scars insane, my life profane
I deny, defy
And spread a little hate, worldwide

Wide open like a gushing open wound
The walls of deceit will come crashing down soon
I've left you defenseless mentally and then
Never fucking hear from you again
Never fucking heard from again
