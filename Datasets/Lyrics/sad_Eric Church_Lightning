These four walls of Fort Worth
Are closin' in on me
My final meter's over
An' their gonna set me free
I can feel the fire's a burnin'
As the devil guards my door
I hit my knees in search of Jesus
On a cold jailhouse floor

Lord, now I'm singin': "Get me out of here"
I see the preacher's eyes
As my daughter cries
When they strap me in this chair
Lord, I hope she forgives me
For livin' my life this way
Tonight I ride the lightning
To my final judgement day

Every life owes a debt
That's what the Bible says
I owe mine to this state
For shootin' that boy to death
A liquor store at ten
He was reachin' for his gun
Well, now his Momma sits there smilin'
As the boss yells: "Roll on one"

And now I'm singin': "Get me out of here"
I see the preacher's eyes
As my daughter cries
When they strap me in this chair
Lord, I hope she forgives me
For livin' my life this way
Tonight I ride the lightning
To my final restin' place

A hungry blue eyed baby cryin'
Made me rob that store
An' as that boy lay there dyin'
I dropped my pistol on the floor
Yeah, I'd take it all back but there's nothin' I can do
They've covered my face
An' the order's gone through
As the boss yells: "Roll on two"

Now I'm flyin'
Up an' out of here
I close my eyes an' slowly rise
Let my body leave this chair
Lord I hope you forgivie me
For livin' my life this way
Yeah, tonight I ride the lighning
To my final restin' place


These four walls of Fort Worth
Are closin' in on me
