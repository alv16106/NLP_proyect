Won't you be my soul boy
Won't you be my soul
There's been no one like you
Trusted and true

I just wanna be loved by you
Just wanna be loved by you
Like a soul boy

Won't you be my soul boy
And take me as I am
I had enough of bad dreams
And one night stands, baby

I just wanna be loved by you
I want to be really loved by you
Like a soul boy

Take me as I am boy, hold me while you can
There's not a woman in the world
Lovin' you better than I do
Take me as I am
Be like a soul boy

I don't wanna be with no one else
I don;t wanna kiss no one else
I want you to be ma soul boy

No more fighting and no more leaving
It ain't exciting and I quit believing
That you're my soul boy, soul boy, soul boy
