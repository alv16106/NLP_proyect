Here's how it goes, girl, if you got it, you gotta work it
For the thrill of gettin' something for nothin'
Behind the bar, he's standin' there, so unaware
He's lookin' like a deer in the headlights

'Cause when we switch it on
It's like, 'oh my god, where did you come from?'
I think I'm in love

No we don't mean to cause you trouble
Or pop your bubble
Just we don't exactly share your intention

Is it just me
Or do the drinks taste better when they're free?
Do the girls agree
That the drinks taste better when they're free?

We play for kicks, not just for credit
We're gonna get it, it's all in how we flutter our lashes
We stop the clock, we know how to make the boys rock
The twenties start to flow from their pockets

And how could you resist a smile like this?
You're a slave to it, then we hit and run
It's gonna hurt, it's gonna sting, when we do our thing
Admit it, boys, you love when we hustle

Is it just me
Or do the drinks taste better when they're free?
Do the girls agree
That the drinks taste better when they're free?
The drinks taste better when they're free

Free, yeah
When they're free, yeah
Free, yeah
When they're free, yeah

We know, we know what the boys like
We know, we know what the boys like
We know, we know what the boys like
So come and get it

Is it just me
Or do the drinks taste better when they're free?
Do the girls agree
That the drinks taste better when they're free?

Is it just me
Or do the drinks taste better when they're free?
Do the girls agree
That the drinks taste better when they're free?

So come and get it
So come and get it
So come and get it
So come and get it
So come and get it
