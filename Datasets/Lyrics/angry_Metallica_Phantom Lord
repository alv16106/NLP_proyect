Sound is ripping through your ears
The deafening sound of metal nears
Your body's waiting for his whips
The taste of leather on your lips

Hear the cry of war, louder than before
With his sword in hand to control the land
Crushing metal strikes on this frightening night
Fall onto your knees for the phantom lord

Victims falling under chains
You hear them crying death pains
The fists of terrors breaking through
Now there's nothing you can do

Hear the cry of war, louder than before
With his sword in hand to control the land
Crushing metal strikes on this frightening night
Fall onto your knees for the phantom lord

The leather armies have prevailed
The phantom lord has never failed
Smoke is lifting from the ground
The rising volume metal sound

Hear the cry of war, louder than before
With his sword in hand to control the land
Crushing metal strikes on this frightening night
Fall onto your knees for the phantom lord

Fall to your knees and bow to the phantom lord
