C'mon man

(And with the local DDC news, LL Cool J with a triumphant comeback...)

Don't call it a comeback
I've been here for years
I'm rockin my peers
Puttin suckers in fear
Makin the tears rain down like a monsoon
Listen to the bass go boom
Explosions
Overpowerin
Over the competition I'm towerin
Records shock
When I drop these lyrics that'll make you call the cops
Don't you dare stare
You better move
Don't ever compare
Me to the rest that'll all get sliced and diced
Competition's payin the price

I'm gonna knock you out
Mama said knock you out
I'm gonna knock you out
Mama said knock you out
I'm gonna knock you out
Mama said knock you out
I'm gonna knock you out
Mama said knock you out

Don't you call this a regular jam
I'm gonna rock this land
I'm gonna take this itty-bitty world by storm
And I'm just gettin warm
Just like Mohammad Ali - they called him Cassius
Watch me bash this beat like a skull
Dont'cha know I had beef with
Why don't you riff with me?
The maniac psycho
And when I pull out my jammy, get ready, 'cause it might go blauh!
How ya like me now?
The ripper will not allow
You to get with Mr. Smith
Don't risk
Listen to my gear shift
I'm blastin
Outlastin
Kinda like Shaft
So you could say I'm Shaftin
Old English filled my mind
And I came up with a funky rhyme

I'm gonna knock you out
Mama said knock you out
I'm gonna knock you out
Mama said knock you out
I'm gonna knock you out
Mama said knock you out
I'm gonna knock you out
Mama said knock you out

Breakdown!

Gangsta boogie, gangsta boogie
Gangsta boogie, gangsta boogie
Gangsta boogie, gangsta boogie (yea)
Gangsta boogie, gangsta boogie (yeah)
Gangsta boogie, gangsta boogie
Gangsta boogie, gangsta boogie
Gangsta boogie, gangsta boogie (uh)
Gangsta boogie, gangsta boogie

Shadow boxin when I heard you on the radio (uh)
I just don't know
What made you forget that I was raw?
But now I got a new talk
I'm goin insane 
Startin a hurricane
Releasin pain
Lettin you know you can't gain or maintain
Unless you say my name
Rippin, killin, diggin and drillin a hole
Past the old goal

I'm gonna knock you out
Mama said knock you out
I'm gonna knock you out
Mama said knock you out
I'm gonna knock you out
Mama said knock you out
I'm gonna knock you out
Mama said knock you out

Shotgun blasts are heard
When I rip and kill at will
The man of the hour
Tower of power
I'll devour
I'm gonna tie you up and let you understand
That I'm not your average man
When I got a jammy in my hand
Damn
Ooh
Listen to the way I slay your crew
Damage (uh), damage (uh), damage (uh), damage
Destruction, terror and mayhem
Pass me a sissy and sucker I'll slay him
Farmers (what?), farmers (what?), I'm ready (we're ready)
I think I'm gonna bomb a town (get down!)
Don't you never, ever, pull my lever
'Cause I explode
And my nine is easy to load
I gotta thank God
'Cause he gave me the strength to rock hard!

Knock you out
Mama said knock you out
I'm gonna knock you out
Mama said knock you out
I'm gonna knock you out
Mama said knock you out
I'm gonna knock you out
Mama said knock you out

Gangsta boogie, gangsta boogie (damn)
Gangsta boogie, gangsta boogie
Gangsta boogie, gangsta boogie
Gangsta boogie, gangsta boogie
Gangsta boogie, gangsta boogie
Gangsta boogie, gangsta boogie
Gangsta boogie, gangsta boogie
Gangsta boogie, gangsta boogie
