It's buried deep within the past, and I hope it doesn't last
(It's something I already chase, I already chase)
I try to give it all away, but it's never gonna fade
(It's something I don't wanna face, I don't wanna face)
I know you feel it's all the same, but I promise that I'll change
(It's something I already chase, I already chase)
You know I'm trying to believe that you're never gonna leave
(It's something I don't wanna face, I don't wanna face)
There's nothing left! The fear is gone...

And when my heartstrings come undone
I will wait for you, pray for you
Before I make my final run
I will stay with you, decay with you

I know I'm not the perfect one, and this pain has just begun
(It's something I already chase, I already chase)
You bring me to a better path, and it's everything I lack
(It's something I don't wanna face, I don't wanna face)
There's nothing left! The fear is gone.
There's nothing left! The fear is gone...

And when my heartstrings come undone
I will wait for you, pray for you
Before I make my final run
I will stay with you, decay with you

If you fade out, without me
You know all about me
If you fade out, without me
You know all

And when my heartstrings come undone
I will wait for you, pray for you
Before I make my final run
I will stay with you, decay with you
I will stay with you, decay with you
