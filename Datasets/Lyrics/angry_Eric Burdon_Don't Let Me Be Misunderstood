Baby, do you understand me now?
Sometimes you see that I get little mad
Don't you know no one alive
Can always be an angel
Every thing goes wrong you seem so bad, girl

I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
Don't let me drown
Don't bring me down, baby

Baby, sometimes I get so carefree
With a joy that's it hard to hide
Then again it seems like well, all I've got to do is worry, yeah
You turn me 'round and you show me the other side

I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
If I get edgy baby, I want you to know
I never mean to take it out on you, yeah
Everybody's got problems more than my share
One thing I never mean to do

Baby don't you know, I love you
I've never had thoughts about any other woman, no
Sometimes I find myself alone regretting, yeah
Some foolish thing, some simple thing I've done

Baby, I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
Don't let me drown
Don't bring me down, no no, no no, oh yeah

If I get edgy, baby, I just want you to know
And I never mean to take it out on you, yeah
Everybody's got problems, I got more than my share
The one thing I never meant to do

Baby, in my darkest hour
It was you who came along to guide me
You put your finger tips upon my forehead
Begging me to stay, don't run away, stay beside me, girl

I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
Let me down, don't let me drown, baby

Oh, I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, don't let me be misunderstood
I'm beggin' you, baby, yeah

I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh my Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood, yeah
Oh baby, oh babe, please don't let me drown, girl
[Incomprehensible] please don't let me
