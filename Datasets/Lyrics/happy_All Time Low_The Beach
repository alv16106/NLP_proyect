Well, you're a long walk from my street
And I'm dying in this summer heat
I hope like hell you're waiting, waiting

Everybody's living like they're crazy in love
I'm a dizzy mess, and everything is so above me
From the floor of any life I lead today

Well, they can take, take, take the kids from the summer
But they'll never, never, never take the summer from me
It was the very first time that I lost my mind for a week
They can make, make, make me forget the weather
If we'll never, never, never wash the sand from my feet
It was the very last time that we said goodbye to the beach
Showing off, we're showing off our teeth

So make one last call back home
Cause tonight we go it alone
And I hope that you know I'm waiting, waiting
(Summer, do you feel me?)

Everybody's singing like they're crazy in love
We made a dizzy mess of everything and it was enough
So bring all the boys and all the girls together

Well, they can take, take, take the kids from the summer
But they'll never, never, never take the summer from me
It was the very first time that I lost my mind for a week
They can make, make, make me forget the weather
If we'll never, never, never wash the sand from my feet
It was the very last time that we said goodbye to the beach
Showing off, we're showing off our teeth

You're going out in style
And I'm getting tired of all your lying
(Summer, do you feel me?)
Stop pretending
Stop, the answer's in the smile
And I'm coming clean
(Summer, do you feel me?)
Just give me something
(Summer, do you feel me?)
Stop pretending

Well, they can take, take, take the kids from the summer
But they'll never, never, never take the summer from me
It was the very first time that I lost my mind for a week
They can make, make, make me forget the weather
If we'll never, never, never wash the sand from my feet
It was the very last time that we said goodbye to the beach
Showing off, we're showing off our teeth
