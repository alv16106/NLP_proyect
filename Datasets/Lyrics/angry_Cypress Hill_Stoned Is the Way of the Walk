(Chorus)
Stoned is the way of the walk
Stoned is the way of the walk

Well, it's the Alley Cat puffin' on a hootie rat,
Some think I'm a criminal, but yo I ain't all of that
Hit'cha with the baseball bat, an' ya wanna ill though
Wanna mess around, you get fucked on the hill bro

Kick it like a steel toe, real slow,
Hits from the bong ,
Make me feel like Cheech, 
And I'm kickin' it wit' Chong,
Just like Cheech & Chong frontin' with "Ice Cream",
Cypress Hill is here to give you a nice dream

Speak it like a rolla' and you know it's rolled tightly
I'm like the funky beat, so, why ya tryin' ta fight me
Pigs often site me, that's not polite G
And any hour of the day ya know I might be

Harassed by a pig real fast
They wanna Rodney King me, always tryin'a crown my ass
Ain't got no class(Sen Dog: No Class)
I hit they' ass like the buddah thats stinkey

They wanna' scruff but, they' just so rinky-dinky
I'm the freaka, the one who freaks the funk
Sen gotts the Philly and he's gonna light the blunt
Sippin' curfew makes me go koo-koo
somthin' like loco then turn in to this loocoo

Binggin the beta,yea, now the funk is risen
Got the beta bass and the nasal highzen
As I kick atrip, it comin' straight from my sinus
Crazy nasal vocals, cannot make the hotties loco
I rimemba sista Maggie, breast were kinda saggy
Used to sell me buddah outta fucked up little baggies

Honeyd up a twenty even when I had no money
She said "Pay me back with some latin dick Sonnie"
Well I neva' went out, and I don' thnk I'm gonna
Just for some buddah, she wanted me ta bone her
Demeaning, ya think ya meanin'

I got somethin' for the hoes ta be skeamin' on
I'm the Buddah-Real take a trip ta hoota'ville
I'll throw ya out the door of my big blue Seville
Then light another joint, this ain't no exploition (point)

'Cause we are the ones stonein' in the ways of the mastas
Stoned is the way of the walk
Stoned is the way of the walk
Stoned is the way of the walk
Stoned is the way of the walk

Hit they, hit they ass
Make the buddah get stinkey
Wooooo, Woooo

(Alas, Cap'in there's a ship in sight,
Huhu, Blast 'em!)
