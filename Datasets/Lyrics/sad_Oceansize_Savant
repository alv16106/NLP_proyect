The future hates cast asleep
But the film remains
This aftertaste
All I wanted's that which I gave

Master slave
I learn fast on sinking ships
And I can talk
I place pride on tick and tock
And it's a lonely silence until dawn

Rites of passage open doors
But I'm not frightened
Master slave
Line and sinker, take the bait

Where others float
You and I crash land
Where others float
You and I crash land

Where I see us in far away skies
I could not say where I am lost
The darkness falls upon the day

There's no answer
