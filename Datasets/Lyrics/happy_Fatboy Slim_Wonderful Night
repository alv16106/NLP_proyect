Yeah. Yeah yeah yeah.
Mmm hmm hmm hmm.
It's a wonderful night
You gotta' take it from me
It's a wonderful night
Come on and break it on down

It's a wonderful night
You gotta' shake it for me
It's a wonderful night
Come on and break it on down

It's a wonderful night
Everybody can see
It's a wonderful night
Come on and break it on down

It's a wonderful night
Go ahead and release
It's a wonderful night
Come on and break it on down

You know the music search engine need a tune-up
Soon as they out the gate they all wanna' hear the corner, uh-huh
Well, that was cool then but now I heard a rumor, uh-huh
Your crew was riding for the white cliffs of Dover, uh-huh
Well let me tell you' how we do it in California
We'll have you on the run just like a puma
If it don't move us, ain't paid your dues
And it ain't gonna' get our groovers, so we lose you to the consumer solution,
Come on!

It's a wonderful night
You gotta' take it from me
It's a wonderful night
Come on and break it on down

It's a wonderful night
You gotta' shake it for me
It's a wonderful night
Come on and break it on down

Girl, I want it, You got it,
Your body's like a narcotic,
The thought is auto-erotic!
Come on and break it on down
Can I get it on credit?
I guess you're brick house, I'll bet it
Take it as far as you'll let it
Come on and break it on down.

That the spot'll get hot,
That it's ready to pop,
Don't even look at the clock,
All of your problems forgotten,
And it's time to rock till you' drop,
Feel the force and just flock to the epicenter of the party's bass tremors, Come on!

It's a wonderful night
You gotta' take it from me
It's a wonderful night
Come on and break it on down

It's a wonderful night
You gotta' shake it for me
It's a wonderful night
Come on and break it on down

We gonna' stimulate your mind
Everybody's high...
Eyes just like a child
Everything feels right
Once you seen the light
You're gonna' move all night
Feel your soul ignite
Everything feels right, right, right!

We live the masterful life, that's mythical
Feel its chords and its vibes, atypical
Do what you want, it's all right, this mystical
Time you've got, that's allotted is plentiful
If you stay in this moment, so critical
Let the music change your brain stem's chemicals
Make you feel like your spirit's invincible,
Force centrifugal,
Reachin' up to your pinnacle, now!

It's a wonderful night
You gotta' take it from me
It's a wonderful night
Come on and break it on down

It's a wonderful night
You gotta' shake it for me
It's a wonderful night
Come on and break it on down

We rock like Colorado
You're at it throwin' bottles
We don't give a fuck about your status; who you are tomorrow
Whether you beg or borrow or hit the super-lotto
Whether your girl look like a minger or a super-model
Feel the connectedness energy disprojected the weighted
The whole collective consciousness arises like helium, up!
Groovin' outta' the question; won't disrespect him, but:
Our style's fuckin' Posh like Dave Beckham, Come on!

It's a wonderful night
You gotta' take it from me
It's a wonderful night
Come on and break it on down

It's a wonderful night
You gotta' shake it for me
It's a wonderful night
Come on and break it on down

The truth I'm at 'em and rough 'em
As hard as the granite get
Never hesitant upon a mic, strike quick
Like an avalanche
Hijack you like a Comanche
I'm a man on a mission
Rhyme vigilante
Keep all the jealous and the envious antsy
Love to do the club, go with the party people dancin' uh-huh
And set the mood for all the plottin' and romancin' uh-huh
It's a wonderful night... We got the answer, Come on!

It's a wonderful night
You gotta' take it from me
It's a wonderful night
Come on and break it on down

It's a wonderful night
You gotta' shake it for me
It's a wonderful night
Come on and break it on down.
