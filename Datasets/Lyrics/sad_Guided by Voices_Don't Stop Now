Woke up one morning
Saw a rooster struttin’ by my house
Six pack rings 'round his neck
Cock o' the block
Don't stop now
Don't stop now

What keeps Big Daddy happy?
What makes the buzzard buzz?
A leaky quart of motor oil
Head for the hills
Don't stop now
Don't stop now

We pulled into Economy Island
King Shit and the Golden Boys
Plenty more where we come from
Top o’ the line
Don't stop now
Don't stop now

Don't stop now
Don't stop now

Don't stop now
Don't stop now

Don’t stop now
