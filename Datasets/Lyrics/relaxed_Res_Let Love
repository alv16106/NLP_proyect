And when the sun runs out
No doubts left standing
We'll see if Jah wills that we're alone again
Let love slip through our fingers I say

Live up, live up, live up
I wanna get up
Instead I give up
Sometimes life dictates what we hate

And when the sun runs out
No doubts left standing
Who knows if it'll go our way
And when the sun runs out
No doubts left standing
Isha Allah it'll be okay

And when the sun runs out
No doubts left standing
Would it be different if we knew we would win
Let love slip through our fingers I say

Live up, live up, live up
Sometimes
Even the season's change
All patterns rearrange

Lord, won't you grant me
New eyes, so I can see
What good are songs with no dances
I wanna live to live and take my chances
I wanna live today
Leave inhibitions in the wind
What good are songs with no dances, I pray
Lord, won't you grant me
Won't you grant me
Lord, won't you grant me
