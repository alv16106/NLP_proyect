Listen to yourself you're a hot mess
St-t-tutter through your words breaking a sweat
What's it gonna take to confess?
What we both know

Yeah, I was outta town last weekend
You were feeling like a pimp round your lame friends
Now your little party's gonna end
So here we go

(Wow-oh-oh-oh-oh) you got a secret
(Wow-oh-oh-oh-oh) you couldn't keep it
(Wow-oh-oh-oh-oh) somebody leaked it
And now some shit's about to go down

I never thought that you would be the one
Acting like a slut when I was gone
Maybe you shouldn't, uh-oh
Kiss and tell

You really should have kept it in your pants
I'm hearing dirty stories from your friends
Maybe you shouldn't, uh-oh
Kiss and tell
Uh-oh-oh

You're looking like a tool and not a baller (baller)
You're acting like a chick why bother? (bother)
I can find someone way hotter
With a bigger, wow
Well

'Cause on top of all the ways that you messed up (messed up)
You weren't smart enough to keep your stupid mouth shut (mouth shut)
I'm so sick of it I've had enough
I hope you die

(Wow-oh-oh-oh-oh) you got a secret
(Wow-oh-oh-oh-oh) you couldn't keep it
(Wow-oh-oh-oh-oh) somebody leaked it
And now some shit's about to go down

I never thought that you would be the one
Acting like a slut when I was gone
Maybe you shouldn't, uh-oh
Kiss and tell
You really should have kept it in your pants
I'm hearing dirty stories from your friends
Maybe you shouldn't, uh-oh
Kiss and tell

(Kiss and tell)
(Kiss and tell us)
(Kiss and tell, an, an)
(Kiss an, and then tell)
(Kiss and tell)
(Kiss and tell, us)
(Kiss and tell, an, an)
(Kiss an, and then tell)

Oh, I hope you know
You gotta go
Yo, get up and go
I don't wanna know
Cover why you're gross
You gotta go
Yo, get up and go
I don't wanna know

I never thought that you would be the one
Acting like a slut when I was gone
Maybe you shouldn't, uh-oh
Kiss and tell

You really should have kept it in your pants
I'm hearing dirty stories from your friends
Maybe you shouldn't (maybe you shouldn't), uh-oh
Kiss and tell (kiss and tell)
Maybe you shouldn't (maybe you shouldn't), uh-oh
Kiss and tell, uh-oh
