New Jersey Turnpike, ridin' on a wet night 'neath the refinery's glow
Out where the great black rivers flow
License, registration--I ain't got none
But I got a clear conscience 'bout the things that I done
Mr. state trooper, please don't stop me
Please don't stop me, please don't stop me

Maybe you got a kid, maybe you got a pretty wife
The only thing that I gots been both'rin' me my whole life
Mr. state trooper, please don't stop me
Please don't stop me, please don't stop me

In the wee, wee hours, your mind gets hazy
Radio relay towers gonna lead me to my baby
The radio's jammed up with talk-show stations
It's just talk, talk, talk, talk till you lose your patience
Mr. state trooper, please don't stop me

Hey, somebody out there, listen to my last prayer
Hi-ho, silver-o, deliver me from nowhere
