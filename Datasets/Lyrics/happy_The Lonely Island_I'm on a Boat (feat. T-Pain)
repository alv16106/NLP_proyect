Whoa, free boat ride for three.  Now, who should I take?
Kiv.  And...T-Pain.
Cool.

(Shawty)
Aw, shit!  Get your towels ready, it's about to go down. (Yeah)
Everybody in the place, hit the fuckin' deck. (Shawty)
But stay on your motherfuckin' toes.  (Yeah)
We runnin' this, let's go...

I'm on a boat (I'm on a boat)
I'm on a boat (I'm on a boat)
Everybody look at me,
'Cause I'm sailin' on a boat! (Sailin' on a boat)
I'm on a boat (I'm on a boat)
I'm on a boat
Take a good hard look,
At the motherfuckin' boat! (Oh, yeah)

I'm on a boat, motherfucker,
Take a look at me
Straight floatin' on a boat
On the deep blue sea (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Bustin' five knots
Wind whippin' at my coat
You can't stop me, motherfucker,
'Cause I'm on a boat

Take a picture, trick (Trick)
I'm on a boat, bitch (Bitch)
We drinkin' Santana champ,
'Cause it's so crisp (Crisp)
I got my swim trunks,
And my flippy-floppies
I'm flipping burgers
You at Kinko's
Straight flippin' copies

I'm ridin' on a dolphin
Doin' flips and shit
The dolphin's splashin'
Gettin' everybody all wet (Oooh)
But this ain't Sea World
This is real as it gets (Yeah, yeah)
I'm on a boat, motherfucker,
Don't you ever forget

I'm on a boat and...
It's goin' fast and...
I got a nautical themed pashmina afghan
I'm the king of the world
On a boat like Leo
If you're on the shore
Then you're sure not me-o

Get the fuck up, this boat is real!

Fuck land, I'm on a boat, motherfucker (Motherfucker)
Fuck trees, I climb buoys, motherfucker (Motherfucker)
I'm on the deck with my boys, motherfucker (Yeah)
The boat engine make noise, motherfucker (The boat engine make noise, motherfucker)

Hey, ma,
If you could see me now (See me now)
Arms spread wide
On the starboard bow (Starboard bow)
Gonna fly this boat
To the moon somehow (The moon somehow)
Like Kevin Garnett,
Anything is possible (Anything is possible)

Yeah, never thought I'd be on a boat (Let's go)
It's a big blue watery road (yeah)
Poseidon, look at me (oooh-ooh) (All hands on deck)
Never thought I'd see the day
With a big boat comin' my way
Believe me when I say
I fucked a mermaid

I'm on a boat (Yeah, yeah)
I'm on a boat (Yeah, yeah)
Everybody look at me,
'Cause I'm sailing on a boat! (Whoa...)
I'm on a boat
I'm on a boat
Take a good hard look,
At the motherfuckin' boat! 

Shawty,
Shawty,
Yeah, yeah yeah.
