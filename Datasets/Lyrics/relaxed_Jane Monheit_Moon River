Moon river, wider than a mile
I'm crossing you in style some day
Oh, dream maker, you heart breaker
Wherever you're goin', I'm goin' your way

Two drifters, off to see the world
There's such a lot of world to see
Were after the same rainbows end, waitin round the bend
My huckleberry friend, moon river, and me
