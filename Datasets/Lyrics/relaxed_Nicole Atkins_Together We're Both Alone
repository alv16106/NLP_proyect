I am raising a flag
I am just too tired now to fight
It's white and it's waving
Can't we save this for another night
I used to be afraid, but now I crave the quiet
Together we are both alone, but I don't mind
I'll dream of something to try and make us all right

Baby, put your arms down
They're machines that can't be fixed no more
Causing the alarm sounds
I'll be right here waiting at your door
We'll sit up on the bed for a while
Together we are both alone, but we don't mind
We'll dream of something to try and make us all right

But the dawn is trouble
When I close my eyes, you never go away
I've tried everything, still you won't change 
Is it better if you go…

But the ending doesn't matter 
One hundred days, ---------
Running faster through this 
Hope to save your heart before it drops
And you didn't even say I didn't try
Together we are both alone, but I don't mind
I dreamt of everything, I tried to make us all right

It's all right, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right
It's all right, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right
It's all right, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right
It's all right, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right
