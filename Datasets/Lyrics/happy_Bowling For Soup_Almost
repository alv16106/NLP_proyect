I almost got drunk at school at fourteen
Where I almost made out with the homecoming queen
Who almost went on to be Miss Texas
But lost to a slut with much bigger breast-es
I almost dropped out to move to L.A.
Where I was almost famous for almost a day

And I almost had you
But I guess that doesn't cut it
Almost loved you
I almost wished you would have loved me, too

I almost held up a grocery store
Where I almost did five years and then seven more
'Cause I almost got popped for a fight with a thug
'Cause he almost made off with a bunch of the drugs
That I almost got hooked on, 'cause you ran away
And I wish I would've had the nerve to ask you to stay

And I almost had you
But I guess that doesn't cut it
Almost had you
And I didn't even know it

You kept me guessing
And now I'm destined
To spend my time missing you
I almost wish you would have loved me, too

Here I go thinkin' 'bout all the things I could have done
I'm gonna need a forklift, 'cause all the baggage weighs a ton (baggage weighs a ton)
I know we had our problems, I can't remember one.

I almost forgot to say something else
And if I can't fit it in, I'll keep it all to myself
I almost wrote a song about you today
But I tore it all up and then I threw it away

And I almost had you
But I guess that doesn't cut it
Almost had you
And I didn't even know it

You kept me guessin'
And now I'm destined
To spend my time missin' you
I almost had you
Almost had you

I almost wished you would've loved me, too
Wished you would have loved me, too
