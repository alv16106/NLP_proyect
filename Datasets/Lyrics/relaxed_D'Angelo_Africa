Africa is my descent
And here I am far from home
I dwell within a land that is meant
For many men not my tone, yeah

The blood of God is my defense
Let it drop down to my seed
Showers to your innocence
To protect you for all eternity
And with this wood I beat this drum
And we won't see defeat

From kings to queens
Becomes a prince
Knowledge and wisdom
Is understanding what we need

(And this day will come)
Ever since the day you came
My whole world began to change
I knew then to dedicate my life
For your own

(And this day will come)
Everyday I see you grow
And remember what you already know
I receive, I receive the love
That radiates from your glow

From which you came was love
And that's how it all should be
You and my soul are I
Through all the time and history, yeah
(And past)
Thank you, thank you
