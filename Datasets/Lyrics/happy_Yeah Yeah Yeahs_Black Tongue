Hot
Ah

You can keep your black tongue
I found at the mortuary
You know they're gonna want some want some
We're high in the back room
Gonna have it packed soon
Who is it son you gonna have
Just let it be a yeah yeah yeah

Sonny kept his ring on
Red tape so ordinary
Love that thing like it was gone gone gone gone
Let's do this like a prison break
I wanna see you scream and shake

Boy you just a stupid bitch and girl you just a no good dick

We're gonna keep it in the family
Yeah well even when we're on the run
You know they're gonna want some want some
We're high in the back room
Gonna have it packed soon
Who is it son you gonna have
Just let it be a yeah yeah yeah

Boy you just a stupid bitch
And girl you just a no good dick!
