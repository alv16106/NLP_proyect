We are the animals
Who have lost our hair
Retained, some of our teeth
And gained a choice
We'll chase food, money and sex
Until satisfied
Then, when it's time to rest
Ask 'what's next?'

We are all animals (x4)

It's hard enough to retain control
When our instincts are egging us on
With biologists and chemists
Reducing our souls
To four letters
And when we think about it
We're like a masterpiece
Who's glimpsed the artist

We are the machines
Carrying on various genes
Then discarded
When the job is done
We are the disciples
Who have lost our way
Kicked from our pedestal
When Darwin burnt the book

Its hard enough to retain control
When our instincts are egging us on
With biologists and chemists
Reducing our souls
To four letters
When genes replace Genesis
We're like a masterpiece
Who's glimpsed the artist

We liked to think we had a special place
As if stars revolved around the human race
But we're just mammals, just primates
Like chimps or g'rillaz
We see the hair on our face
And look at another primate
You and I, we relate
