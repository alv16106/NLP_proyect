In the cool of the evening
When everything is getting kind of groovy
You call me up and ask me
Would I like to go with you and see a movie?
First I say no, I've got some plans for tonight
And then I stop and say "All right"
Love is kind of crazy with a spooky little boy like you
Spooky

You always keep me guessing
I never seem to know just what you are thinking
And if a girl looks at you
Yeah, for sure your little eye will be a-winking
I get confused, I never know where I stand
And then you smile and hold my hand
Love is kind of crazy with a spooky little boy like you
Spooky

If you decide some day to stop this little game that you are playing
I'm gonna tell you all the things my heart's just been dying to be saying (straight up)
Just like a ghost you've been haunting my dreams
Now I know you're not what you seem
Love is kind of crazy with a spooky little boy like you
Spooky
