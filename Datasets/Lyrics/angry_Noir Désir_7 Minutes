Between skies and field
This land in midnight lights
Cold summer, cold summer
Till the end of time

The earth's like a belly
An heavy sleeping beast
But with her big eyes open
And cities are inside
Still standing on the hill
This city's like an ocean
Enjoy the metal waves
In which we drown ourselves

Don't you breathe anymore
Are you far from the next corner?
Your race is burning the pavement

Welcome to the city
The city's done for you
Yell with the underdogs
Make sure they won't bite you
