If you knew what I know, would you try
Before your time has run anew and worn you down?
Would you know what you deserve in your heart?
And if you knew what I knew would you try?

Is there time, is there time
To follow just one desire?
Is there time, is there time
To follow your heart's?

Dress your wounds, test your strength, face the night
Crave the touch, feel the pain, know the signs
Is there truth in your pain? You decide
If you knew what I know, would you try?

Is there time, is there time
To follow just one desire?
Is there time, is there time
To follow your heart's?

As we lie in the shade of poison trees
Are we as safe as we like ourselves believe?
