I knew that someday I was gonna die. And I knew before I died two things would happen to me.
That number one: I would regret my entire life, and number two: I would want to live my life over again.

Life is lead weights, pendulum died. Pure or lust? Spectator or crucified?
Recognised truth, acedia's blackest hole. Junkies, winos, whores; the nation's moral suicide

Loser. Liar. Fake or phoney? No one cares
Everyone is guilty. Fucked up, dunno why, you poor little boy

We are all of walking abortions. Shalom, shalom, we all love our children
We all are of walking abortions. Shalom, shalom, there are no horizons

Mussolini hangs from a butcher's hook. Hitler reprised in the worm of your soul
Horthy's corpse screened to a million. Tiso revived, the horror of a bullfight

Fragments of uniforms; open black ruins, a moral conscience
You've no wounds to show, so wash your car in your 'X' baseball shoes

We are all of walking abortions. Shalom, shalom, we all love our children
We all are of walking abortions. Shalom, shalom, there are no horizons

Little people in little houses, like maggots; small, blind and worthless
The massacred innocent blood stains us all

Who's responsible? You fucking are. Who's responsible? You fucking are
Who's responsible? You fucking are
(Who's responsible? You fucking are who's responsible)
