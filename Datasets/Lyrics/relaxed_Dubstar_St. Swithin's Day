Thinking back now
I suppose you were just stating your views
What was it all for?
For the weather or the Battle of Agincourt
And the times that we all hoped would last
Like a train they have gone by so fast
And though we stood together at the edge of the platform
We were not moved by them

With my own hands
When I make love to your memory
It's not the same
I miss the thunder, I miss the rain
And the fact that you don't understand
Casts a shadow over this land
But the sun still shines from behind it...

Thanks all the same
But I cannot bring myself to answer your letters
It's not your fault
But your honesty touches me like a fire
The polaroids that keep us together
Will surely fade away
Like the love that we spoke of forever
On St. Swithin's Day...
