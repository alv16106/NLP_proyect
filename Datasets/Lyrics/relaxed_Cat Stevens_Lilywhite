Back up on the mended road
I pause
Taking time to check the dial

And the Lilywhite
I never knew her name
But she'll be passing my way sometime again.

I raise my hand and touch the wheel
Of change
Taking time to check the dial

Thank the Lilywhite
I never knew her name
But she'll be passing my way sometime again.
But she'll be passing my way sometime again.
