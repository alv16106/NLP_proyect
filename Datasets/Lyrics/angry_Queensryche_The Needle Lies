Nikki:
"I've had enough and I WANT OUT!"

Dr. X:
"You can't walk away now."

I looked back once and all I saw was his face
Smiling, the needle crying
Walking out of his room with mirrors, afraid
I heard him scream: "You'll never get away."

Cold and shaking I crawled down alleys
To try and scrape away the tracks that marked me
Slammed my face into walls of concrete
I stared, amazed at the words written on the wall

Don't ever trust
Don't ever trust the needle, it lies
Don't ever trust
Don't ever trust the needle when it cries
Cries your name

Wet and raving, the needle keeps calling me back
To bloody my hands forever
Carved my cure with the blade that left me in scars
Now every time I'm weak, words scream from my arm

Don't ever trust
Don't ever trust the needle, it lies
Don't ever trust
Don't ever trust the needle when it cries
Cries your name

Don't ever trust
Don't ever trust the needle, it lies
Don't ever trust
Don't ever trust the needle when it cries
Cries your name
