He had an unfamiliar face
Complete life in disarray
A simple man, power drunk
No worries of living, no more anything

Deep inside I've seen it rise
Actions progress to no end
Mirror, mirror, please look inside
Do you see the reasons that we sin?

Not one to be forgot
Spoiled rotten, so they say
Once burned, forever marked
Hurt by just a few but so many have to pay

Deep inside I've seen it rise
Actions progress to no end
Mirror, mirror, please look inside
Do you see the reasons that we sin?

Pressure
Coming down
Down on me
Gonna break
Broken
Fingernails
Digging in
Scratch my face

Nervous
Like a cat
Gonna jump
Through my skin
Shadows
On the wall
Stretching out
Grope for me

(Reasons) Deep in me
(Reasons) Let me be
(Reasons) Let me bleed
(Reasons) Set me free
(Reasons) Set me free
(Reasons) Set me free
(Reasons) Set me free
(Reasons) The reasons that we sin
