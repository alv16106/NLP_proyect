(You go spooky in a band)

Son, I'm thirty
I only went with your mother 'cause she's dirty
And I don't have a decent bone in me
What you get is just what you see, yeah

I see it so I take it greedy
And all the bad piss-ugly things I feed me
I never help or give to the needy
Come on and see me

Yippee-ippee-ey-ey-ay-yey-yey
I had too crucify some brother today
And I don't dig what you gotta say
So come on and say it

Come on and tell me twice

I said, "Dad, youâ€™re a shabby.
You run around and groove like a baggy.
You're only here just out of habit.
All is mine you might as well have it.
You take ten feet back and then stab it
Spray it on and tag it."

So sack on me
I can't stand the needy
Get around here if you're asking you're feeling

Yippee-ippee-ey-ey-ay-yey-yey
I had too crucify somebody today
And I don't dig what you gotta say
So come on and say it

Come on and tell me twice

So sack all the needy
I can't stand to leave it
You come around here and you put both your feet in 

Yippee-ippee-ey-ey-ay-yey-yey
I had too crucify somebody today
And I don't hear what you gotta say
So go on and say it

Yippee-ippee-ey-ey-ay-yey-yey
I had too crucify some brother today
And I don't hear what you gotta say
So come on and say it
Come on and tell me twice...
