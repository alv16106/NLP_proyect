It's on your hand
The scratching choices
The streets are shallow
And so were the sounds

Impatient road
Is asking questions
From the hour before this
Before anything

Fireworks went off that night
When alice went home
Dreams exploding in the sky
It's all very strong
There she goes alone, outside
Thinking you and i

The tired toungue
Is leaking stories
From a minds caotic
Map of the passed

Surrender now
You save the clicks and hours
'Cause your sorrow's breaching
In the hours to come

Fireworks went off that night
When alice went home
Dreams exploding in the sky
It's all very strong
There she goes alone, outside
Thinking you and i
