Looking like a born again
Living like a heretic
Listening to Arthur Lee records
Making all your friends feel so guilty
About their cynicism
And the rest of their generation
Not even the government are going to stop you now

But are you ready to be heartbroken?
Are you ready to be heartbroken?

Pumped up full of vitamins
On account of all the seriousness
You say you're so happy now
You can hardly stand
Lean over on the bookcase
If you really want to get straight
Read Norman Mailer
Or get a new tailor

Are you ready to be heartbroken?
Are you ready to be heartbroken?
Are you ready to bleed?

What would it take
What would it take to wipe that smile off of your face?
Are you ready to be...
Are you ready to bleed?
