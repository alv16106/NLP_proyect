Karakasa no hone wa
Bara bara
Kamya yaburete mo
Take ni sotaru
En ja mo
Mis're nasaru na
Nambo watashi ga
Yaburete mo
Us'te shon shon

Translation of Japanese:
The ribs of the umbrella
Have fallen apart;
The paper is also torn,
But with bamboo
Tied together.
Do not throw it away.
Though I
Also am torn,
Don't desert me.
