Educated with money
He's well dressed not funny
And not to say in most conversations
But he'll foot the bill in all situations
'Cause he pays for everything

Girls don't like boys, girls like cars and money
Boys will laugh at girls when they're not funny

Paper or plastic,
Don't matter she'll have it
Vacations and shopping sprees these are a few of her favorite things
She'll get what she wants if she's willing to please
His type of girl always comes with a fee
Hey now there's nothing for free

Girls don't like boys, girls like cars and money
Boys will laugh at girls when they're not funny
And these girls like these boys, like these boys like these girls
The girls with the bodies like boys with Ferraris
Girls don't like boys, girls like cars and money

Let's go!

Girls don't like boys, girls like cars and money
Boys will laugh at girls when they're not funny
And these girls like these boys, like these boys like these girls
The girls with the bodies like boys with Ferraris
Girls don't like boys, girls like cars and money

All of these boys, and all of these girls
Are losing their souls in a material world
All of these boys, and all of these girls
Are losing their souls in a material world
All of these boys, and all of these girls
Are losing their souls in a material world
All of these boys, and all of these girls
Are losing their souls in a material world
