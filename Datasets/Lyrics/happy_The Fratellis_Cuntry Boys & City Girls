I said I don't get out too much I said
She said she said I said two times instead
I said oh please please please no
You're just not funny ya know
So stick around here for a week or three or four
I passed out one time by your door
It was twenty to four though I just can't be sure

Cinderella, Cinderella 
She's my very kinda fella
Part right half wrong 
Oh you know it won't be too long
And oh you know we cuntry boys
Are only after sex and noise
Take me shake me I'm a real mess, oh yes
I love the way you city girls dress
Even though your head's in a mess

Well it was some kind of house by some kind of road
With some kind of peculiar dress code
All the boys had no style 
Not one girl did she smile
I said you're making me itch she said  don't
I said I'll try my best she said I know that you won't
Now it's time to go home while I was chewing her bone

Baby doll, baby doll 
Climbing on the bedroom wall
Got no real friends at all 
Maybe she's a mother or two
But I think she's into you
Take me home, take me home
Call my mother on the phone
Ella was her name when I left but now she is Rose
She got no fingers or toes
Lost them everywhere that she goes now (5×)

Cinderella, Cinderella

Oh you know it won't be too long (Oh yeah)
And oh you know we cuntry boys
Are only after sex and noise
Take me, shake me, I'm a real mess oh yes
I love the way you city girls dress

Baby doll, baby doll

But I think she's into you
Take me home, take me home
Call my mother on the phone
Ella was her name when I left but now she is Rose
She got no fingers or toes
She lost them everywhere that she goes, now
Lost them everywhere that she goes, now (7×)
Lost them everywhere that she goes.
