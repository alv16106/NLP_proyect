For everything you do
I'd like to swallow you
And every day I'm gonna blame you
Even if you justify
Every fuckin' bullshit lie
It only makes me want to break you

You pull me down
And you crucify my name
You make me insane
It's broken now
Don't ever look my way
Don't even think I'm playin'

'Cause I fuckin' hate you
You're such a liar
I love to hate you
You're all the same to me

When you repeatedly
Take advantage of me
The only thought I get of you sickens me
Everybody knows you're fake
You're everything I fuckin' hate
And I'm everything that you could never be

You pull me down
And you crucify my name
You make me insane
It's broken now
Don't ever look my way
Don't even think I'm playin'

'Cause I fuckin' hate you
You're such a liar
I love to hate you
You're all the same to me
I fuckin' hate you
You're such a liar
I love to hate you
You're all the same to me

(Fuck you)
(Fuck you)
(Fuck you)
(Fuck you)

You pull me down
And you crucify my name
You make me insane
It's broken now
Don't ever look my way
Don't even think I'm playin'

'Cause I fuckin' hate you
You're such a liar
I love to hate you
You're all the same to me
I fuckin' hate you
You're such a liar
I love to hate you
You're all the same to me

Fuck you
Fuck you
Fuck you
Fuck you
Fuck you
Fuck you
Fuck you
