Baby your magic is working
I lose control of myself when ever you are near me
I feel myself changing
From a guy too cynical for love
Into a blushing romantic
Oh honey I'd swim across the Atlantic
Just to be near to you I'm hopping like a kangaroo

Baby your magic is working
All of my friends think I'm mad
'Cause I talk of nothing but you girl
How you've really changed me
From a guy thought too cynical for love
You've proven everyone wrong
Anywhere with you girl is where I belong
Everything is beautiful and you are the reason

Lately I've been so happy
Just holding you and gazing into your eyes
Like in a movie
You are a star... I mean a starlet,
Listen the night we met I fell in love with you
Who'd have guessed who'd have guessed
I'm in love I'm in love

How you've really changed me
From a guy thought too cynical for love
Suddenly I feel as light as a butterfly
And wanting to give love another try
Everything is beautiful and you are the reason

Baby your magic is working
My mirror's reflection is you
Looking coquet and smirking
Now your magic is working
