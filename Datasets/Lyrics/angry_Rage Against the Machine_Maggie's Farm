I ain't gonna work on
Maggie's Farm no more.
No, I ain't gonna work on
Maggie's Farm no more.
Well, I wake up in the morning
Fold my hands and pray for rain
I got a head full of ideas
That are driving me insane.
It's a shame
The way she makes me
Scrub the floor.

I ain't gonna work on
Nah! I ain't gonna work on
Maggie's Farm no more.

I ain't gonna work for
Maggie's brother no more.
Nah, I ain't gonna work for
Maggie's brother no more.
When he hands you a nickel
He hands you a dime
And he asks you with a grin
If you're having a good time.
Then he fines you every time
You slam the door!
I ain't gonna work for
Nah! I ain't gonna work for
Maggie's brother no more!

I ain't gonna work for
Maggie's pa no more.
Nah! I ain't gonna work for
Maggie's pa no more.
Well, he puts his cigar
Out in your face just for kicks. 
His bedroom window
It is made out of bricks.
The National Guard 
Stands around his door.
I ain't gonna work for
Nah! I ain't gonna for 
Maggie's pa no more.

I ain't gonna work for
Maggies ma no more.
Nah, I ain't gonna work for
Maggie's ma no more.
Well, she talks to all the servants
About land and God and law.
And everybody says
She's the brains behind pa.
She's 68, but she says she's 24!
I ain't gonna work for
Nah! I ain't gonna work
For Maggie's ma no more!

I ain't gonna work on 
Maggie's Farm no more.
No, I ain't gonna work on
Maggie's Farm no more.
Well, I try my best
To be just like I am
But everybody wants you
To be just like them!
They sing while you slave
And I just get bored.
Well I ain't gonna work on
Nah! I ain't gonna work on
Maggie's Farm no more.

Ah!
