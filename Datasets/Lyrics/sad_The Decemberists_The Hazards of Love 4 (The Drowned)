William:
Margaret, array the rocks around the hole before we're sinking
A million stones, a million bones, a million holes within the chinking
And painting rings around your eyes, these peppered holes so filled with crying
A whisper-weight upon the tattered down where you and I were lying
Tell me now, O tell me this—a forest's son, a river's daughter
A willow wand, a will-o-wisp, our ghosts will wander all of the water

William & Margaret:
So let's be married here today, these rushing waves to bear our witness
And we will lie like river stones, rolling only where it takes us

But I pulled you and I called you here (Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I)
And I caught you and I brought you here (Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I)
But these hazards of love never more will trouble us

William:
O Margaret, the lapping waves are licking quietly at our ankles
Another bow, another breath—this brilliant chill has come for to shackle

William & Margaret:
But with this long, last rush of air let's speak our vows in starry whisper
And when the waves came crashing down, he closed his eyes and softly kissed her

(Singing,) But I pulled you and I called you here (Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I)
And I caught you and I brought you here (Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I)
But these hazards of love never more will trouble us
And these hazards of love never more will trouble us
