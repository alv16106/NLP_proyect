Silver shadow
Glowing shadow
Shining brightly
For all to see

I remember gazing on this quiet night
The stars were bright as they could be
Wondering if things would ever go right
And if there was a spot up there for me
Then one star got brighter by the minute
Strange that it seemed to have my name written in it
I reached for the star and it kissed me with it's light
It made me cast a show that was silver and bright

Silver shadow
Glowing shadow
Shining brightly
For all to see

I never had any real reason
To thank my lucky stars
But now I got a pretty good reason cause
I know I'm gonna go so far
I believe in magic, I really do
With all that's happened, it's got to be true
I cast a silver shadow from the kiss of the light
I knew that I was destined starting with tonight

Silver shadow
A glowing shadow
Shining brightly
For all to see
Silver shadow
My future shadow
Trying to tell me
Of a star I would be

Oh, since I was chosen among the rest
I dedicate myself, I'm gonna be the very best
And my shadow forever silver will remain
And the world will always remember my name

Silver shadow
A glowing shadow
Shining brightly
For all to see
Can't believe I cast a silver shadow
My future shadow
Trying to tell me
Of a star I would be
Hey, yeah

Look at my shadow glow
Silver with wonder, this sparkling thing
Look at my shadow glow
Think I'm gonna be a star, whoa, whoa, whoa, ooh, whoa
Look at my shadow glow
Glowing so brightly, this wondrous thing
Look at my shadow glow
Look at my silver shadow, shadow, shadow, shadow
