I've become resistant to myself
To my weaknesses and pain
I've become the one who wants to live
And just feel alive again

I've changed
Myself
I've changed [x2]

I've become addicted to being strong
Started out my second life
And the remnants of your tears and smiles
Shift deleted from my mind

Without
Knowing how it hurts
I feel safe [x2]

Is this
What I
Really
Wanted? [x2]

Without... - x2
