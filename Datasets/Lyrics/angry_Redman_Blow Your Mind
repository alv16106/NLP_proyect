Ah! Look out, it's the Funkadelic Funk for chumps
Who don't be knowin' my name, I tear the frame out ya punks
I make ya slide, make ya slip, make ya wanna backflip
I get biz with the skit, I DJ like Quik
The topnotch of the block, 'cause I carry a glock
Only hot rocks I'm hot, so give up the props
My style is HUMMIN CUMMIN ATCHA, duck or get backed up
Dispatcher: 'Red, get freaky to the rapture'
So come on light the buddha check your honey while I scoop her
The Soopafly, Jimmy fly Snooka rips the roof off
Then hook off on your crew, to the check of one to two
It's you, who? (AGA-Ah! WWAAAAAH!) Redman with the Kung-Fu
Come on and get down and boogie oogie with the ruffneck
Hit women like Madonna all the way down to Smurfette
But first get your tables I roast your whole record label kids
Yo E (Whassup G?) Briiiiiidge!
