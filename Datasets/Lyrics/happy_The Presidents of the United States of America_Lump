Lump sat alone in a boggy marsh
Totally motionless except for her heart
Mud flowed up into lump's pajamas
She totally confused all the passing piranhas

She's lump, she's lump
She's in my head
She's lump, she's lump, she's lump
She might be dead

Lump lingered last in line for brains
And the one she got was sorta rotten and insane
Small things so sad that birds could land
Is lump fast asleep or rockin' out with the band?

She's lump, she's lump
She's in my head
She's lump, she's lump, she's lump
She might be dead
Low!

Baa bow
Ba ba ba ba dow
Baa bow
Ba ba ba da da da
Baa bow
Ba ba ba da da na
Naa bow

Lump was limp and lonely and needed a shove
Lump slipped on a kiss and tumbled into love
She spent her twenties between the sheets
And life limped along at subsonic speeds

She's lump, she's lump
She's in my head
She's lump, she's lump, she's lump
She might be dead
Woo!

Is this lump outta my head?
I think so
Is this lump outta my head?
I think so, yeah! Woo!
Is this lump outta my head?
I think so
Is this lump outta my head?
