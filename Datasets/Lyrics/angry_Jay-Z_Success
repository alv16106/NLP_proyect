Your Success took a shot at you
What are you going to do now?
How are you gonna kill it?
You gonna become unsuccessful?
Frank, you can be successful and have enemies
Or;
Be unsuccessful too and you can have friends

I got these niggas breezy, don't worry about it.

Let that bitch breath,

I used to give a fuck, now I give a fuck less.
What do I think of success
It sucks, too much stress
I guess I blew up quick, cause friends I grew up with
See me as a pre-me but I'm not and my nuts big
I don' know what the fuss is
My cribs illustrous
My rep is impeccable
I'm not to be fucked with



Shit
Let that bitch breath...

I'm way to important to be talking about extortin'
Asking me for a portion is like asking for a coffin
Broad day light I off your on switch
Ya not too bright, goodnight, long kiss
Bye, bye my reply
Bla bla
Blast burnin and pass burnin the ta ta
Finish my breakfast, why?
I got an appetite for destruction and you're a small fry
Now where was i?

Let that bitch breathe

I used to give a shit, now I don give a shit more
Truth be told, I had more fun when I was piss poor
I'm pissed off
This what success all about?
A bunch of niggaz actin' like bitches with big mouths
All this stress, all I got is this big house
Couple cars I don bring half them shits out
