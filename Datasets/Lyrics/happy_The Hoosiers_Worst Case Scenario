You got out the wrong side of bed and liked it
The only love he gets is unrequited
Mourning Monday all week long's not healthy
But being happy's only for the wealthy

You can't see past the worst case scenario
You'd be happier instead if you'd stayed in bed
I pray one day I'll live to see you break a smile

Wallow in your miserable mess as you tend to
You've mastered looking unimpressed, do I offend you?
Mourning Monday all week long's not healthy
But being happy's only for the wealthy

You can't see past the worst case scenario
You'd be happier instead if you'd stayed in bed
I pray one day I'll live to see you break a smile
I pray one day I'll live to see you break a smile
I pray one day I'll live to see you break a smile
I pray one day I'll live to see you break a smile

You can't see past the worst case scenario
You'd be happier instead if you'd stayed in bed
You can't see past the worst case scenario
You'd be happier instead if you'd stayed in bed

I pray one day I'll live to see you break a smile
I pray one day I'll live to see you break a smile
I pray one day I'll live to see you break a smile
I pray one day I'll live to see you break a smile
