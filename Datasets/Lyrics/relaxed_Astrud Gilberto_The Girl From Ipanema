Olha que coisa mais linda
Mais cheia de graça
É ela, a menina
Que vem e que passa
Num doce balanço
Caminho do mar

Moça do corpo dourado
Do sol de Ipanema
O seu balançado
É mais que um poema
É a coisa mais linda
Que eu já vi passar

Ah, but I watch him so sadly
How can I tell him I love him
Yes, I would give my heart gladly
But each day when he walks to the sea
He looks straight ahead not at me

Ah, se ela soubesse
Que quando ela passa
O mundo sorrindo
Se enche de graça
E fica mais lindo
But she doesn't see
But she doesn't see

Ah, but I watch him so sadly
How can I tell him I love him
Yes, I would give my heart gladly
But each day when he walks to the sea
He looks straight ahead not at me

Ah, se ela soubesse
Que quando ela passa
O mundo sorrindo
Se enche de graça
E fica mais lindo
But she doesn't see
But she doesn't see

But she doesn't see
He doesn't see
But she doesn't see
He doesn't see
But she doesn't see
But she doesn't see
No She doesn't see
