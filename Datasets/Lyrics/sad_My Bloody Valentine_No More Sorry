What happened now and again
And then again and again
Loved me black and blue
No more sorry

Flesh and bone not alone
You're not alone waiting by the telephone
Whatever you do
Don't call daddy

In my hair, everywhere
Everywhere and everywhere
Fingerprints of you
Filthy daddy

Wash and mend and wash and mend
Some kind of friend, your septic heart and deadly hand
Loved me black and blue
No more sorry
