Lookin' at himself but wishin he was someone else
Because the posters on the wall that don't look like him at all.
So he ties it up he tucks it in he pulls it back he gives a grin,
Laughin' at himself because he knows he ain't loved at all.
He gets his courage from the can, it makes him feel like a man
Because he's lovin' all the ladies but the ladies don't love him at all.
When he's not drunk he's only stuck on himself,
And then he has the nerve to say he needs a decent girl.

Lookin' at herself but wishing she was someone else
Because the body of the doll that don't look like hers at all.
So she straps it on she sucks it in she throws it up and gives a grin,
Laughin' at herself because she knows she ain't that at all.
All caught up in the trends well the truth began to bend
And the next thing you know man there just ain't no truth left at all.
'Cause when the pretty girl walks, she walks so proud,
And when the pretty girl laughs, oh man, she laughs so loud.

And if it ain't this then it's that as a matter of fact.
She hasn't had a day to relax,
Since she's lost her ability to think... clearly.

Well I'm an energetic, apathetic version of another person.
Check out my outsides there ain't nothing in here
Well I'm a superficial, systematic, music television addict.
Check out my outside there ain't nothing in here.-comes another one,
Just like the other lookin' at himself but wishin he was someone else because
The posters on the wall that don't look like him,
Ties it up and tucks it in and pulls it back and gives a grin.
Laughing at himself because he knows he ain't loved at all.
Knows he ain't loved at all
