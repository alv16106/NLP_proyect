I'm a jealous man
Ooh, I can't relate
She's a doe-eyed girl
Ooh, with no complaints

But there's another side that I'm trying to crack
If you open your mind and let me take a stab
At the secrets that you know
Sweet troubled soul

She's a summer tramp
Ooh, all dressed in black
A fluorescent tan
Ooh, sweet heart attack

Oh, but there's another side that I'm trying to crack,
If you open your mind and let me take a stab
At the secrets that you know
Sweet troubled soul

Whoa, whoa, whoa

Whoa, I want to suffer in your arms
And whoa, and when you're naked in the dark
I want to see your face in the reflection of my bedroom stereo
We'll take it slow
Sweet troubled soul

But there's another side that I'm trying to crack,
If you open your mind and let me take a stab
At the secrets that you know
Just let it goooo...

Whoa, I want to suffer in your arms
And whoa, and when you're naked in the dark
I want to see your face in the reflection of my bedroom stereo
We'll take it slow
Sweet troubled soul

Oh, sweet troubled soul
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
