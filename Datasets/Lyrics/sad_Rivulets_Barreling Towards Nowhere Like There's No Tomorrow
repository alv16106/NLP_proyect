And you remember
The sound of the waves
From the wood upon which you stood
And you remember
The sound of the waves
From the wood upon which you stood

And you used to rush out to greet them
With open arms
You used to rush out to greet them
With open arms

Now
We know where you'll be at twelve
We know where you'll be at four
Now
We know where you'll be at twelve
We know where you'll be at four

Walking down
To the liquor store

Yeah
That'll keep you warm now
That'll keep you warm now
