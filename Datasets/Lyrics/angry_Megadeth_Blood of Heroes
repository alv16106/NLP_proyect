Walking stiff, let me tell ya
Better left for dead
And now we are on a mission
Well, it's full speed ahead
My legions, when we do the crime
Let's get one thing straight
To get there early is on time
And showing up on time is late

Ladies and gents
We're still alive
By the skin of our teeth
Now it's killing time
Angel in our pocket
Devil by our side
We ain't going nowhere, 'cause heroes never die

(Still alive) Blood of heroes
(Never die) They never die
(Still alive) Blood of heroes
(Never die) They never die

We've been run down every hill
Chased up all the dead end streets
But if you try to cut us out
You'll get a kick in the teeth

Ladies and gents
We're still alive
By the skin of our teeth
Now it's killing time
Fasten up your head belts
It's time to ride the skies
It's time to be immortal, 'cause heroes never die

(Still alive) Blood of heroes
(Never die) They never die
(Still alive) Blood of heroes
(Never die) They never die

Blood of heroes
Blood of heroes
Blood of heroes
They never die
(Still alive) Blood of heroes
(Never die) Blood of heroes
(Still alive) Blood of heroes
(Never die) Blood of heroes
