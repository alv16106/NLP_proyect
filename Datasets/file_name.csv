0,ML1,George Michael,I Want Your Sex,happy,"There's things that you guess
And things that you know
There's boys that you can trust
And girls that you don't

There's little things you hide
And little things that you show
Sometimes you think you're gonna get it
But you don't and that's just the way it goes

I swear I won't tease you
Won't tell you no lies
I don't need no bible
Just look in my eyes

I've waited so long baby
Now that we're friends
Every man's got his patience
And here's where mine ends

I want your sex
I want your love
I want your sex
I want your... sex

It's playing on my mind
It's dancing on my soul
It's taken so much time
So why don't you just let me go

I'd really like to try
Oh, I'd really love to know
When you tell me you're gonna regret it
Then I tell you that I love you but you still say NO

I swear I won't tease you
Won't tell you no lies
I don't need no bible
Just look in my eyes

I've waited so long baby
Out in the cold
I can't take much more girl
I'm losing control

I want your sex
I want your love
I want your sex
I want your... sex

It's natural
It's chemical (Let's do it)
It's logical
Habitual (Can we do it?)

It's sensual
But most of all...
Sex is something that we should do
Sex is something for me and you

Sex is natural, sex is good
Not everybody does it
But everybody should
Sex is natural, sex is fun
Sex is best when it's... one on one
One on one

I'm not your father
I'm not your brother
Talk to your sister
I am a lover

C-c-c-c-come on

What's your definition of dirty baby
What do you consider pornography
Don't you know I love it till it hurts me baby
Don't you think it's time you had sex with me

What's your definition of dirty baby
What do you call pornography
Don't you know I love it till it hurts me baby
Don't you think it's time you had sex with me

Sex with me
Sex with me
Have sex with me

2,ML3,Katatonia,12,sad,"Black theatre of love
Violet dancers cast their blood
The moon gave me flowers
For funerals to come

12 shapes bow before her
I am still one of them
12 morbid ways to die
Her beauty scares me

I'm falling deeper
No more pain to feel now
Touch the silence
Afraid of hell

Black theatre of love
Violet dancers drink my blood
The moon gave me flowers
For funerals to come

I cannot breathe
I am losing life
The moon paints the skyline blue
She died so beautiful"
3,ML4,Bing Crosby,Swinging On A Star,happy,"Would you like to swing on a star
Carry moonbeams home in a jar
And be better off than you are
Or would you rather be a mule?

A mule is an animal with long funny ears
Kicks up at anything he hears
His back is brawny but his brain is weak
He's just plain stupid with a stubborn streak
And by the way, if you hate to go to school
You may grow up to be a mule

Or would you like to swing on a star
Carry moonbeams home in a jar
And be better off than you are
Or would you rather be a pig?

A pig is an animal with dirt on his face
His shoes are a terrible disgrace
He has no manners when he eats his food
He's fat and lazy and extremely rude
But if you don't care a feather or a fig
You may grow up to be a pig

Or would you like to swing on a star
Carry moonbeams home in a jar
And be better off than you are
Or would you rather be a fish?

A fish won't do anything, but swim in a brook
He can't write his name or read a book
To fool the people is his only thought
And though he's slippery, he still gets caught
But then if that sort of life is what you wish
You may grow up to be a fish

A new kind of jumped up slippery fish

And all the monkeys aren't in the zoo
Everyday you'll meet quite a few
So you see it's all up to you
You can be better than you are
You could be swingin' on a star"

Images of perfection, suntan and napalm. Grenada, Haiti, Poland, Nicaragua
Who shall we choose for our morality? I'm thinking right now of Hollywood tragedy
Big Mac, Smack, Phoenix R please smile y'all. Cuba, Mexico can't cauterize our discipline
Your idols speak so much of the abyss, yet your morals only run as deep as the surface

Cool, groovy, morning, fine, Tipper Gore was a friend of mine
I love a free country, the stars and stripes and an apple for Mommy

(Conservative say) There ain't no black in the union jack
(Democrat say) There ain't enough white in the stars and stripes

Compton, Harlem, a pimp fucked a priest; the white man has just found a new moral saviour
Vital stats: how white was their skin? Unimportant, just another inner-city drive-by thing
Morning, fine, serve your first coffee of the day; real privilege, it will take your problems all away
Number one, the best, no excuse from me. I am here to serve the moral majority

Cool, groovy, morning, fine, Tipper Gore was a friend of mine
I love a free country, the stars and stripes and an apple for Mommy

Zapruder, the first to masturbate. The world's first taste of crucified grace

And I was dead

Outside in the crowded places, ships are sailing through the wood
Impossible
Leaving in the space between the Bovis homes, the railway heath
Impossible

I can see my freedom but I need a little time
Your hair wet and your arms full

You know tomorrow's just a day away,
If you can keep your heart beatin' then your ass awake.

You feel the hollows burnin'

17,ML18,Avenged Sevenfold,Coming Home,angry,"I've been away, searching for a reason
Another purpose to find
I've sailed the seas, fought my many demons
I've looked to gods in the skies

I've stood in Hell, where many had to suffer
I stabbed the Devil in the eyes
Walked many roads to witness ancient idols
And found the great Gates of Fire

Had many storms question my conviction
Gave armies reason to rise
The Hangman's searching for bones he can borrow
While I escaped in the night!
Final plight!

Live again; I won't sin!
I'll be coming home
Tend your light, cause on this night
I'll be coming home

Escape the hell of capitulated mortals
And drink the blood of a king
A desert rain has washed away direction
Had angels looking after me so it seems

Live again; I won't sin!
I'll be coming home
Tend your light, cause on this night
I'll be coming home

My story ends not far from where it started
My weary limbs have grown old
I've seen the world through the eyes of a nomad
Home is where the heart is, I've been told
So I go!

Live again; I won't sin!
I'll be coming home
Tend your light, cause on this night
I'll be coming home

I'm coming home
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
I'm coming home"

19,ML20,The Streets,Never Went to Church,sad,"Two great European narcotics,
Alcohol and Christianity,
I know which one I prefer

We never went to church,
Just get on with work and sometimes things'll hurt,
But it's hit me since you left us,
And it's so hard not to search.

If you were still about,
I'd ask you what I'm supposed to do now,
I just get a bit scared,
Every now,
Hope I made you proud.

On your birthday when mum passed the forks and spoons,
I put my head on the table I was so distraught with you,
You tidied your things into the bin,
The more poorly you grew,
So there's nothing of yours to hold or to talk to.

You'd put your hand up and interrupt the conversation with a, but...
People say I interrupt people with the same look.
Sometimes I think so hard I can't remember how your face looked,
Started reading about dreams in your favourite book.

I panic and pace when I can't see the right thing to do.
You'd be scratching your head through the best advice you knew.
And I feel sad I can't hear you reciting it through,
I miss you dad but I've got nothing to remind me of you

We never went to church,
Just get on with work and sometimes things'll hurt,
But it's hit me since you left us,
And it's so hard not to search.

If you were still about,
I'd ask you what I'm supposed to do now,
I just get a bit scared,
Every now,
Hope I made you proud.

I needed a break when your book about dreams was taken,
I needed to pray or see a priest that day,
I needed to leave this trade and just heave it away.
But I cleaned up my place like you so I could see things straight.

I never cared about God when life was sailin' on the calm,
So I said I'd get my head down and I'd deal with the ache in my heart,
And for that if God exists I'd reckon he'd pay me regard,
Mum says me and you are the same from the start.

I guess than you did leave me something to remind me of you,
Everytime I interrupt someone like you used to,
When I do something like you you'll be on my mind or through,
'Cause I forgot you left me behind to remind me of you.

We never went to church,
Just get on with work and sometimes things'll hurt,
But it's hit me since you left us,
And it's so hard not to search.

If you were still about,

Just get on with work and sometimes things'll hurt,
But it's hit me since you left us,
And it's so hard not to search.

But you you still tell me how you didn't know what to do even now,
And then I'm not so scared somehow,
'Cause I know that you'd be proud.

I got a good one for you dad,
I'm gonna see a priest, a Rabbi and a Protestant clergyman,
You always said I should hedge my bets."

Hurry up and catch 'em
You grab an arm I grab an arm let's pull till we stretch 'em
Play pussy, get fucked
Means you're better off dead
I wanna see food so I fished in a child's head
Motherfuckers be worried 'cause I'm sick
Dead heads and frog legs
Mmm... cake mix!
Friday the 13th
The night of the living dead
Vampire arms walkin' 'round givin' niggas head
If you didn't die, I'd say you got lucky
All bodies found dead
Fuck it, blame it on Chuckie
But this is child's play... motherfucka!

Aw fuck, Chuck's on a killin' spree!
Gimme some barb and I'll start by killin' me!
When I murder, I tried to slack off
Now 100 missiles blew a little girl's back off
My name is Chuckie, some say I'm insane
You give me some gin, and I might eat a dog's brain!
Give me a motherfuckin 15-pack
And I'll be damned if I don't bring 15 dead niggas back!
A murder contest,
You know I'll win it
Cause in every mailbox, there be a head with a knife in it
I'm gettin' hungry
I need to be fed
I feel like eatin' a bag of barbequed broke legs!
Bustin' necks with a motherfuckin' brick!
Half my body is Chuckie
The other half is Bushwick

Always pumpin' some lead
Haven't figured out a way to get my fist out your forehead
What up
Get up
Sit up
You get lit up
A knife in his neck made a polar bear spit up
A 9, a Uzi is my only utensils
Inside his chest they found 10,000 pencils
You have the nerve to try to go against Chuck?
With fifty guns aimed at you
How the fuck you gonna duck?
Yo,
When I'm mad, I'm ready to slay
The graveyards are packed
But it ain't nothin' but child's play

You'd better murder me
Put me to rest
'Cause if you don't I'll come out shootin
With my head in a bird's chest
Pissed off,
The way I'm always soundin'
Killed a punk in '82, and they just now found 'im
Some say I'm crazy
Some say I'm on crack
Before I die
Cut off my leg and let me die in Iraq
A born loooser
Some say I'm mindless
If I get pissed off
You leave naked and spineless
Worse than Charles Manson
Never havin' a equal
Went sleepwalkin' last night and killed 300 people
When I woke up they had me chained to the floor
When they told me what I did I killed 300 more
Yo
You wanna rumble?
Then go get your war hat
I went to jail for assault with a carjack
I might be small
But my nuts are big
The worst that you could do is let me keep your fuckin' kids
'Cause I'm a teach 'em how to act
And if they ain't actin' right
They dyin' tonight!
So, uh
Ain't no use in you tryin' to spot 'em
I send you a motherfuckin note that says ""Chuckie's got em!"""

The blood-stained walls, the lines of chalk on the floor
It's getting so hard
I never saw the backlash when the tide began to rise
I can't remember
The way it was when everything felt right
My mouth held shut and my eyes sealed tight with control

So I remember on the inside

I found a dark, infernal place I don't want to face anymore
Somehow, I won't stop feeding the pain
My heart's just the same as before

So now I'm stuck here
Between the guilty and the insincere
The words I spoke have left me here all alone
I should have known this
I never saw the backlash when the tide began to rise
I wish it all gone
I could've burned it when I had the choice
And now I'd die to kill this noise in my head

So I remember on the inside

I found a dark, infernal place I don't want to face anymore
Somehow, I won't stop feeding the pain
My heart's just the same as before

Should I stay or go?
Should I sleep or stay awake?
Am I really happy, or is it all just an illusion?

Sitting in my room now - Hiding thoughts,
Just hoping one day I'll get out
I hear a voice call my name,
Breaking trance, so silent,
So I can stay the same

Wait now, many things left unsaid
This life remains the same, but I change
I try to fool myself in believing
Things are going to get better, but life goes on

Only minded now with defeats of yesterday

Let loose you hair
We're intertwined forever and have always been
Say the word
And I'll depart
Upon your lips dwells nothing but the meaning of my cause

Vibrant as ever before
Flowers already withered
In this endless winter of souls

Outside in the park
The days move along
And nothing ever changes
They have nothing on us
And we've always knew
That nothing ever changes

Feeding off the warmth
Lured out from inside

Depending on the life blood

And then she'd call me up, just to wake me up
But she's alright
She's alright

Mary is my bright red star
She likes to look at the pink sky just before the day turns dark
And then she'd call me up, just to wind me up
But she's alright
She's alright

Mary is my bright red star
She wears a hat in the sun, pink nails and her bleach blond locks
And then she'd call me up, so we could meet up
But she is alright
She's alright

Mary is my bright red star
We just talk into the night about nothing in particular
And then she'd hang me up, until she'd wake me up

Born in this world as it all falls apart
We are strong but we don't belong
Born in this world as it all falls apart

I see the children in the rain
Like the parade before the pain
I see the love, I see the hate
I see this world that we can make
I see the life, I see the sky
I'd give it all to see you fly
Yes, we wave this flag of hatred
But you're the ones who made it

Watch the beauty of all our lives
Passing right before my eyes
I hear the hate in all your words
All the wars to make us hurt
We get so sick, oh, so sick
We never wanted all this
Medication for the kids
With no reason to live

So we march to the drums of the damned as we come
Watch it burn in the sun, we are numb

We are young but we have heart
Born in this world as it all falls apart
We are strong but we don't belong
Born in this world as it all falls apart

As we walk among these shadows
In these streets, these fields of battle
Take it up, we wear the medal
Raise your hands with burning candles
Hear us whisper in the dark
In the rain you see the spark
Feel the beating of our hearts
Fleeting hope as we depart

All together walk alone
Against all we've ever known
All we've ever really wanted
Was a place to call our home
But you take all we are
The innocence of our hearts
Made to kneel before the altar
As you tear us apart

So we march to the drums of the damned as we come
Watch it burn in the sun, we are numb

We are young but we have heart
Born in this world as it all falls apart
We are strong but we don't belong
Born in this world as it all falls apart

We will fight (We will fight)
Or we will fall (We will fall)
Till the angels save us all
We will fight (We will fight)
Or we will fall (We will fall)
Till the angels save us all

We will fight (We will fight)
Or we will fall (We will fall)
Till the angels save us all
We will fight (We will fight)
Or we will fall (We will fall)
Till the angels save us all

We are young but we have heart
Born in this world as it all falls apart
We are strong but we don't belong
Born in this world as it all falls apart

We are young but we have heart
Born in this world as it all falls apart
We are strong but we don't belong
Born in this world as it all falls apart"
39,ML40,Hooverphonic,The Magnificent Tree,relaxed,"Bought this guitar
At a shop called mars
But on the way back home
Strange things happened in my car
Started to play
All by itself
Creatures jumped from
The highest shelf
Until I touched string 12
This magnificent tree
Appeared in my mind
Even without leaves
ITS strength was divine
Synthesized gnomes
Penetrated this godly zone
Summer was thrown off
ITS royal THRONE
This magnificent tree
Appeared in my mind
Even without leaves
ITS strength was divine"

Catch it's breath a stream of life,
The tallest trees stretch to the sea,
And to the edge where shadows meet.

A quiet place and nature's way,
A season comes and whispers life,
Still born again into golden dreams,
A Hiding place beneath blue skies.

Cross the lines down shifting lights,
Catch it's breath a stream of life,
The tallest trees stretch to the sea,
And to the edge where shadows meet."

Now they blew up his house, too
Down on the boardwalk they're getting ready for a fight
Gonna see what them racket boys can do

Now there's trouble busing in from out of state
And the D.A. can't get no relief
Gonna be a rumble out on the promenade
And the gambling commission's hanging on by the skin of its teeth

Well now, everything dies, baby, that's a fact
Maybe everything that dies someday comes back
Put your makeup on, fix your hair up pretty
And meet me tonight in Atlantic City

Well, I got a job and tried to put my money away
But I got debts that no honest man can pay
So I drew what I had from the Central Trust
And I bought us two tickets on that Coast City bus

Now, baby, everything dies, baby, that's a fact
But maybe everything that dies someday comes back
Put your makeup on, fix your hair up pretty 
And meet me tonight in Atlantic City

Now our luck may have died and love may be cold 
But with you forever I'll stay
We're going out where the sand's turning to gold 
So put on your stockings, baby, 'cause the night's getting cold 

And everything dies, baby, that's a fact
But maybe everything that dies someday comes back

Now I been looking for a job but it's hard to find
Down here, it's just winners and losers and don't get caught on the wrong side of that line
Well, I'm tired of coming out on this losing end
So, honey, last night I met this guy and I'm gonna do a little favor for him

Well, I guess everything dies, baby, that's a fact
But maybe everything that dies someday comes back
Put your hair up nice, fix yourself up pretty 
And meet me tonight in Atlantic City
Meet me tonight in Atlantic City 
Meet me tonight in Atlantic City
Meet me tonight in Atlantic City"

But I'm afraid to say them
I feel I've been had and I'm boiling mad
Still I can't live without you

You don't have the time and you won't spend a dime
Not even to call me
You don't know I exist and I wouldn't be missed
If I had the nerve to quit you

Invisible - I feel like I'm invisible
You treat me like I'm not really there
And you don't really care
I know this romance
It ain't going nowhere
Invisible (just like my love)
You treat me like I'm invisible
When you get the need to flirt you do your worst
You just don't care how much it hurts

I can never reach you on the phone
It rings and rings
But I know you're home
It may be naive but I just want to believe I'm the only one

I tell myself lies and give you alibies
Knowing your promises you'll never keep
Like the merry go round
I'm going up
I'm going down
I'm on a dead end street

Invisible (just like my love)
I feel like I'm invisible
You treat me like I'm not really there
And you don't really care
I know this romance
It ain't going nowhere

Although I know it's not a lot
Don't want to lose whatever we got
I keep hanging on knowing I can't win
'Cause it's too hard start over again

Well take what you want 'cause I've got nothing
Pass me some pills, I'll go to bed
But however much I toss and turn I feel a dark place up ahead

Some nights I just sit right here, I remember, I just remember
Before it all got lost up in the mess
He said, ""Not all men are bad, and I am not like your dad
And I will hold you, even though you're slightly mad
'Cause I am not a man who will ever break you""

But my body gave up too soon

I am just fine till I'm on my own
Somebody please come home

I hate the way I tremble when you touch me
You're like a needle slowly piercing my skin
I hate the way my stomach aches
And I really hate these loveless mistakes
'Cause I'm screaming for my rock who never picks up

Maybe if I skip my dinner, make myself pretty and thinner
Maybe then he'll love me and stop looking at the other girls

So you said I'm paranoid? I'm paranoid? I nearly choked
And no more of that crap
You cannot break someone who's just been broken

You can't break somebody who's just been broken

So take me now I'm naked
As you watch I'll let you take it
Maybe then you'll love me and stop looking at the other girls

You said I'm paranoid? Well paranoid I nearly choked

No more of that crap
You cannot break someone who's just been broken

You can't break somebody who's just been broken

To see you walk away"
46,ML47,Tom Lehrer,We Will All Go Together When We Go,happy,"spoken:
I am reminded at this point of a fellow I used to know
Whose name was Henry, only to give you an idea of what
A individualist he was, he spelled it H-E-N-3-R-Y -
The three was silent, you see
Henry was financially independent, having inherited his
Father's tar-and-feather business, and was therefore
Able to devote his full time to such intellectual pursuits
As writing. I particularly remember a heartwarming novel
Of his about a young necrophiliac who finally achieved his
Boyhood ambition by becoming coroner... (The rest of you
Can look it up when you get home.)
In addition to writing, he indulged in a good deal of
Philosophizing. Like so many contemporary philosophers, he
Especially enjoyed giving helpful advice to people who were
Happier than he was. And one particular bit of advice which
I recall - which is the reason I bring up this whole dreary
Story - is something he said once, before they took him away
To the ""Massachusetts State Home for the Bewildered""
He said: ""Life is like a sewer - what you get out of it depends
On what you put into it."" It's always seemed to me that this
Is precisely the sort of dynamic, positive thinking that we so
Desperately need today in these trying times of crisis and
Universal brouhaha. And so with this in mind, I have here a
Modern, positive, dynamic, uplifting song, in the tradition
Of the great old revival hymns. This one might more accurately
Be termed a survival hymn. It goes like this

sung:
When you attend a funeral
It is sad to think that sooner o'
Later those you love will do the same for you
And you may have thought it tragic
Not to mention other adjec-
Tives, to think of all the weeping they will do
(But don't you worry.)
No more ashes, no more sackcloth
And an armband made of black cloth
Will some day never more adorn a sleeve
For if the bomb that drops on you
Gets your friends and neighbors too
There'll be nobody left behind to grieve

And we will all go together when we go
What a comforting fact that is to know
Universal bereavement
An inspiring achievement
Yes, we all will go together when we go

We will all go together when we go
All suffuse with an incandescent glow
No one will have the endurance
To collect on his insurance
Lloyd's of London will be loaded when they go

Oh we will all fry together when we fry
We'll be French fried potatoes by and by
There will be no more misery
When the world is our rotisserie
Yes, we will all fry together when we fry

Down by the old maelstrom
There'll be a storm before the calm

And we will all bake together when we bake
There'll be nobody present at the wake
With complete participation
In that grand incineration
Nearly three billion hunks of well-done steak

Oh we will all char together when we char
And let there be no moaning of the bar
Just sing out a Te Deum
When you see that I.C.B.M
And the party will be ""come-as-you-are.""

Oh we will all burn together when we burn
There'll be no need to stand and wait your turn
When it's time for the fallout
And Saint Peter calls us all out
We'll just drop our agendas and adjourn

You will all go directly to your respective Valhallas
Go directly, do not pass Go, do not collect two hundred dolla's

And we will all go together when we go
Ev'ry Hottenhot an' ev'ry Eskimo
When the air becomes uranious
And we will all go simultaneous
Yes we all will go together
When we all go together
Yes, we all will go together when we go"

Put down together in round
When I'm feeling the right
Holding to catch the stars

57,ML58,Cradle of Filth,Dirge Inferno,angry,"Carrion my name
For those who choose to mouth the curse
A tragic serenade
With Judas in my stride
The Gothic halls of shame
Where statues coldly hold no worse
Than the murders I reclaim
From a dark, forsaken time

Kissing heaven, spent
He wipes lips free of his hectic discharge
Wishing to repent
For the brute that ravaged free
In slight hands beauty weeps
Conquest's deep methodical screwing
Hurt repeatedly
Like the world wound at his feet

Dirge Inferno

As it is written, damn it
So let it be wrung
From throats of those in overthrow
The past at last has come

A savage bit without respite
Pervades the freezing air
This winter chill, grist for his mill
If tears of joy will blear elsewhere
And church bells drown in the cracks of doom
The storms above us hew
As lightning runs like bifurcate tongues
Deflowering two by two

Hissing, malcontent
He storms the skies on electric discharge
Pissing in contempt
On the effigies of the weak
Killing all resolve
The great beast simmers, his scarlet women
Spit their vitriol
On the terrified face of peace

Dirge Inferno

As it is written, damn it
So let it be wrung
From throats of those in overthrow
Our past at last has come

A hellbound heart, the rose and thorn
Have locked to hasten blood
The moon disrobes, to harden droves
Of legions pouring
These rivers press, his breath adorns
Senates and enemy seats
Whilst his power takes as ingratitude
The writhing of the weak

""Wormwood my name
The poisoned star that fell to earth
And blistered free of shame
In the pits of self-rebirth
Now those caves become a farret
Overseeing endless barracks
As the waters turn to claret
And the Vatican satins burn"

No locked doors, no windows barred
No things to make my brain seem scarred

Sleep, my friend, and you will see

They keep me locked up in this cage
Can't they see it's why my brain says ""Rage""

Sanitarium, just leave me alone

Build my fear of what's out there
Cannot breathe the open air
Whisper things into my brain
Assuring me that I'm insane

But violent use brings violent plans
Keep him tied, it makes him well
He's getting better, can't you tell?

No more can they keep us in
Listen, damn it, we will win
They see it right, they see it well
But they think this saves us from our hell

When the happiness of love has gone away
And you never want to go out on the street again
And you only seem to live from day to day.

I've become addicted to being strong
Started out my second life
And the remnants of your tears and smiles
Shift deleted from my mind

Without
Knowing how it hurts
I feel safe [x2]

Is this
What I
Really
Wanted? [x2]

Without... - x2"
83,ML84,Saybia,The One For You,sad,"I hold a picture in my hand
And though I understand
I'm drifting into space
Your eyes are covered by a cloud
Containing all your doubts
You held your lies with grace

I'm not the one for you
I'm not the one for you
You are the one for me
I'm not the one for you
I'm not the one for you
You are the one for me

The Sunday mornings on your own
I guess I should have known
But trust had blinded me
I guess I knew it all the time
When he was on your mind
I never had a chance

I'm not the one for you
I'm not the one for you
You are the one for me
I'm not the one for you
I'm not the one for you
You are the one for me

She takes no time to explain why she goes

You are the one for me"
84,ML85,The Jam,Bricks And Mortar,angry,"Bricks and mortar, reflecting social change,
Cracks in the pavement, reveal cravings for success
Why do we try to hide our past
By pulling down houses and build car parks
Windows and mirrors like a two-way glass
This is progress, nothing stands in its path

Yellow bulldozers, the donkey jackets and J.C.B.'s
While hundreds are homeless they're constructing a parking space

Why do they have to knock them down
And leave the site dormant for months on end?
Who has the right to make that choice?
A man whose home has cost forty grand

Tell me!

Bricks and mortar, bricks and mortar
Knock 'em down!"
85,ML86,Symphony X,The Divine Wings Of Tragedy,sad,"I. AT THE FOUR CORNERS OF THE EARTH (lyrics: Romeo, Pinnela)

On the edge of paradise
Tears of woe fall, cold as ice
Hear my cry
Renounce, have you, thy name
Eternal is my pain

Eternal is the pain that leads me to the thrones of temptation
Eternal is the pain that leads me to the thrones of temptation
Eternal is my pain that leads me to the thrones of temptation

II, IN THE ROOM OF THRONES (instrumental)

III. A GATHERING OF ANGELS (lyrics: Michael Romeo)

There was a time
When nine choirs sang the endless melody of light
Music of the spheres

There was a place
Where mortals embraced thunder and majesty
Their fate lay in our hands

Feel my wings slowly fading (ooh)
Forever lost in time (ooh)
I cry (ooh)

IV. THE WRATH DIVINE (lyrics: Michael Romeo, Thomas Miller)

The burning conflict I'm feeling
It summons me to descend into the other side
And just beyond the stars blazing
A beam light from a red, velvet moon illuminates me

I will devise
From perfect skies, a dark and vengeful day
Faith and mercy gone astray

With strength of infinite measure
The mighty sword divides order from chaos in the kingdom below
And from the mansions of glory
This empty soul cries out one final plea - the end has begun

Our worlds collide
Now in disguise you'll feel the Wrath Divine
Tears of woe fall from the sky

V, THE PROPHET'S CRY (lyrics: Michael Romeo)

The prophet cries
Vast battalions rage on in the sky
Rising from the north - the bringer of war
Eve of destruction
Summon all who have power over fire
Impending doom from shore to shore

Standing on the edge of paradise
I sacrifice my truth and loyalty
Seven deadly sins consume you all, a dance with death
I taste the victory

Rising from the north - the warrior prince (Eternal is the pain that leads me to temptation)
Judgement without compassion eyes of fear
Like the river styx, the gates of hell (Eternal is the pain that leads me to temptation)
""Abandon hope all ye who enter here""

The prophets cry
As armies fall from the edge of the sky
The Prince of truth, now the bringer of war

The day of wrath
Banish all kings from the face of the land
Dominion for strength is my name

VI. BRINGER OF THE APOCALYPSE (instrumental)
I. Eve of Sacrifice
Ii. Armies in the Sky
Iii. Dies trae

VII. PARADISE REGAINED (lyrics: Russel Allen, Michael Pinnella)

Looking out on a blue sky
I can see a new world arising
Like a prisoner unbound
I feel the power and the majesty again

Looking up to the heavens
I can see what I've left behind
Beneath the stars, moon and warm sun
And all I know is my paradise has begun"
86,ML87,Nirvana,Scentless Apprentice,angry,"Like most babies smell like butter
His smell smelled like no other
He was born scentless and senseless
He was born a scentless apprentice

Away
Go away, go away

Every wet nurse refused to feed him
Electrolytes smell like semen
I promise not to sell your perfumed secrets
There are countless formulas for pressing flowers

Away
Go away, go away

I lie in the soil and fertilize mushrooms
Leaking the gas we'll make into perfume
You can't fire me because I quit!
Throw me in the fire and I won't throw a fit

Hey, go away
Go away, go away
Go away, go away
Go away, go away"
87,ML88,Deborah Harry,End Of The Run,sad,"Darkness falls like a black leather jacket and melts into the sidewalk like a sleeping drunk.
In the streets, the wind throws yesterday's headlines around.
Another night comes and goes.

So, for awhile back then there was someplace to go.
Somewhere more home than a house.
A family of choice, not an accident, but sometimes as soon as something gets started it's over.

Now the days are much shorter and the people from the good part of town all come around, but the something is missing even though there's more there now.
I shrug off my attempts to explain how a torn t-shirt made it all danger again.

I don't like flashbacks in movies.
I like the story to proceed.
I don't like talking about the old days except if it tells where the future will lead.

So we take a walk down this haunted hall or stumble through a shattered recall.
I know there's nothing to relive, it's just the shape of it all.
I don't want it different.
Don't want it again but value for value, now I'd never want it to end.
You think of the old friends and faces no more to be seen.
You think how much fun a line-up would mean.

And once that tape starts playing, it's too hard to make it rewind.
That one special face takes over your mind.

That end of the run.
We almost won.
The end of the run.
We had our fun.
The end of the run.


I knew it then.
It won't be back again.

We stood in the cold night, though we should be warm, in the back of the lot with me in your arms.
The sun was falling.
The grey rain was pouring.
The cars were all dirty and slow.
We both had our kiss and, out of the depths and darkness, with my eyes closed I still see you fine.
Cause that was the season we make our dreams come true.
There was no limit to what we could do.

The end of the run.
We almost won.
The end of the run.
We had our fun.
The end of the run.
I knew it then.
He won't be back again.

Once that tape starts playing it's too hard to make it rewind.

90,ML91,The Ataris,The Boys Of Summer,happy,"Nobody on the road
Nobody on the beach
I feel it in the air
The summer's out of reach
Empty lake, empty streets
The sun goes down alone
I'm drivin' by your house
Though I know you're not at home

I can see you
Your brown skin shinin' in the sun
You got your hair combed back and your sunglasses on, baby
And I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone

I never will forget those nights
I wonder if it was a dream
Remember how you made me crazy?
Remember how I made you scream?
I don't understand what happened to our love
But baby when I get you back
I'm gonna show you what I'm made of

I can see you
Your brown skin shinin' in the sun
I see you walkin' real slow and you're smilin' at everyone
I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone

Out on the road today
I saw a BLACK FLAG sticker on a Cadillac
A little voice inside my head said, ""Don't look back, You can never look back.""
I thought I knew what love was
What did I know?
Those days are gone forever
I should just let them go but

I can see you
Your brown skin shinin' in the sun
You got that top pulled down and that radio on, baby
And I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone

I can see you
Your brown skin shinin' in the sun
You got that hair slicked back and those Wayfarers on, baby
I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone"

'Cause they know I'm coming straight back home to you, and they know I'm a constant fool for you - so I'm putting my things on a U-haul and I'm blockin out your number when you call

No conversation you can keep your words, cause 90% I done already heard, how long did you think that I would sit here for, I'm letting you know it's not exceptional

No conversation you can save the games, and anything you say I will remain the same. How long did you think that I would sit here for, destroying my soul, it ain't exceptional

I can't believe you even tried to blame me, 'cause you're the one who changed I've been the same me

And I been by your side like a 2 way and like a pager with no clamp that's how you lose me

So my friends come to help me get over you - 'cause they're sick and tired of seeing what I'm going through

I put all of my things on a U-haul and I won't accept at all whenever you call.

I should have left your ass long time ago, I was too scared to be out on my own

You made me feel there was no other way

And I won't find love I would be lonely -- ??

You made me feel so damn low

Now take a look at what's happening, this is tragic like when Michael left the Jackson's, I told you you should be careful what you're askin'

You wished I would have left you with some quiet time, but now you got more time than anytime

I know you never thought that I could jet out, but I left before you could tell me get out

No conversation you can keep your words, 90% I done already heard, how long did you think that I would sit here for, I'm letting you know it's not exceptional

She wanted him, oh she wanted him.

Of filth, grime or dirt.
An overwhelming urge
To smile, laugh and flirt.

Don't take a genius to understand the reason why.

This girl he thought she was,
Living in a dream.
It's just that he was,
Exceptionally clean.
All the boys that she, that she had known before,
Avoided hygiene.
Around at his house,
You could eat off the floor,
Which was slightly unnerving.

Hygiene boy, oh what am I to do?
I feel positively filthy standing next to you.

Something of an anomaly.
You see this perfect boy,
Wasn't quite so pristine,
He had ideas that would (He had ideas that could),
Make the Devil scream.

With his corny jokes and his cheap cigars
He could look you in the eye and sell you a car

But no one ever knew a more charming creature
On this earth than my old man

He was a pilot in the big war in the U.S. Army Air Corps
In a C-47 with a heavy load
Full of combat cargo for the Burma Road
And after they dropped the bomb
He came home and married mom
And not long after that
He was my old man

And oh the fights we had
When my brother and I got him mad
He'd get all boiled up and he'd start to shout
And I knew what was coming so I tuned him out
And now the old man's gone, and I'd give all I own
To hear what he said when I wasn't listening
To my old man

I miss the old man tonight
And I can almost see his face
He was always trying to watch his weight
And his heart only made it to fifty-eight
For the first time since he died
Late last night I cried
I wondered when I was gonna do that

Down on me, down on me, down on

Insincere as we rolled for years in turning barrels
I washed my hands in the lake
As you blew it all away with roman candles
So take your fever, let me wallow alone

So I was up all night thinking about you
I thought that you were right, you were right
You were right, you were

You were right, and I was up all night

And I couldn't speak
Covered with bees you flew above me
Figured it all out, I think you've had enough time
I've had long enough to change my mind

This dope money here is little Trey's scholarship
'Cause ain't no tuition for having no ambition
And ain't no loans for sittin' your ass at home

We claim other people kids on our income tax
We take that money, cop work, then push packs to get paid

Mama say she wanna move south
Scratchin' lottery tickets, eyes on a new house
'Round the same time, Doe ran up in dude house
Couldn't get a job, so since he couldn't get work, he figured he'd take work

When you stop the programs for after-school
And they DCFS, some of 'em dyslexic
They favorite 50 Cent song ""12 Questions""
We scream, ""Rocks, blow, weed, park,"" see, now we smart
We ain't retards, the way teachers thought
Hold up, hold fast, we make more cash
Now tell my mama I belong in that slow class
Sad enough we on welfare
They tryna put me on the school bus with the space for the wheelchair
I'm tryna get the car with the chromie wheels here
They tryna cut our lights out like we don't live here
Look what was handed us, fathers abandoned us
When we get them hammers, go on, call the ambulance
Sometimes I feel no one in this world understands us

I talk to God.
He's screaming.

I need to be where you are.

It's draining but pain has reservoirs it keeps for itself.

The bubbles.
The surface race.

The voice of God is laced with sarcasm in your hands.

All dressed up to go away
First time I'd seen him smile in years

He stopped loving her today
They placed a wreath upon his door
And soon they'll carry him away
He stopped loving her today

You know, she came to see him one last time
Oh, and we all wondered if she would
And it kept running through my mind
This time, he's over her for good

He stopped loving her today
They placed a wreath upon his door
And soon they'll carry him away
He stopped loving her today"

Y déjame estrechar tus manos,

Ay, ven y cuéntame una historia
que me haga sentir bien.

Yo te escucharé
con todo el silencio del planeta,
y miraré tus ojos
como si fueran los últimos de este país.

Ayyyyyy...
Déjame ver como es que floreces
con cinco pétalos te absorberé,
cinco sentidos que te roban
sólo un poco de tu ser.

Y seis meses para vivirte
debajo de una misma luna,
y otros nueve pasarán para
sentir que nuevas flores nacerán.

Y que cada estrella
fuese una flor,
y así regalarte
todo un racimo de estrellas.

No dejes que amanezca,

122,ML123,Jack Johnson,"They Do, They Don't",relaxed,"Tied down against the tracks
Screaming in silent black and white
Why'd you trust us we are such villains
We would tell ourselves anything
We want to hear if we are willing
To listen is to learn
Then too much is what we deserve

And how come when we say that we do
We don't
Pray to anybody you want
We won't
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

But if we're the ones to blame then the fruit
Shouldn't taste so good we were used
Used to thinking we got nothing to lose
We're losing everything but the truth
Is walking straight into a roadblock ending left here bending
Your point of view was chosen by the serpent's ruse

With all its do's and don'ts
The future is an empty promise
Unconcerned and so tired of waiting
We could sell it wooden horses
Full of nightmares and when they open
This all might recompose
There's no going back to the good old days
It's just a phase bring in some new life
Archaism is a dusty road leading us back to nowhere

But if we're the ones to blame then the fruit
Shouldn't taste so good we were used
Used to thinking we got nothing to lose
We're losing everything but the truth
Is walking straight into a roadblock ending left here bending
Your point of view was chosen by the serpent's ruse

How come when we say we do
We don't
How come when we say we will
We won't"
123,ML124,Pearl Jam,Crazy Mary,sad,"She lived on the curve in the road
In an old tar paper shack
On the south side of the town
On the wrong side of the tracks

Sometimes on the way into town
We'd say, ""Mama can we stop and give her a ride?""
Sometimes we did
But her hands flew from her side
Wild eyed Crazy Mary

Down the long dirt road, past the parson's place
That old blue car we used to race
Little country store with a sign tacked to the side
Said ""No L-O-I-T-E-R-I-N-G Allowed""
Underneath that sign always congregated quite a crowd.

Take a bottle drink it down, pass it around
Take a bottle drink it down, drink it
Pass it around, pass it a-
A-take a bottle drink it down, pass it
Pass it a-, pass it around

One night thunder cracked
Mercy backed outside her windowsill
Dreamed I was flying high above the trees, over the hills
Looked down into the house of Mary
Terrible thoughts, newspaper covered walls
And Mary rising up above it all

Oh
Oh
Oh

Next morning on the way into town
Saw some skid marks and followed them around
Over the curve
Through the fields
Into the house of Mary

That what you fear the most could meet you halfway
That what you fear the most could meet you halfway

Take a bottle drink it down, pass it around
Take a bottle drink it down, pass it a-, pass it around
Take a bottle drink it down, pass it a-, pass it around

Yeah

Pass it around
Pass it a-, pass it a-"

Que sem ela
Não pode ser

É que sem ela não há paz, não há beleza
É só tristeza
E a melancolia que não sai de mim
Não sai de mim
Não sai

Mas se ela voltar
Se ela voltar
Que coisa linda
Que coisa louca
Pois há menos peixinhos
A nadar no mar
Do que os beijinhos
Que eu darei na sua boca

Dentro dos meus braços
Os abraços hão de ser milhões de abraços
Apertado assim
Colado assim
Calado assim
Abraços e beijinhos
E carinhos
Sem ter fim
Que é pra acabar com esse negócio
De viver longe de mim
Não quero mais esse negócio
De você viver assim
Vamos deixar desse negócio
De você viver sem mim

Nobody on the beach
I feel it in the air
The summer's out of reach

Empty lake, empty streets
The sun goes down alone
I'm drivin' by your house
Though I know you're not home

But I can see you-
Your brown skin shinin' in the sun
You got your hair combed back and sunglasses on, baby
And I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone

I never will forget those nights
I wonder if it was a dream
Remember how you made me crazy?
Remember how I made you scream
Now I don't understand what happened to our love
But babe, I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna show you what I'm made of

I can see you-
Your brown skin shinin' in the sun
I see you walkin' real slow and you're smilin' at everyone
I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone

Out on the road today, I saw a Dead Head sticker on a Cadillac
A little voice inside my head said,
""Don't look back. You can never look back.""
I thought I knew what love was
What did I know?
Those days are gone forever
I should just let them go but

I can see you-
Your brown skin shinin' in the sun
You got that top pulled down and that radio on, baby
And I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone

As I slowly slide the hanger up your thigh..."

152,ML153,Conway Twitty,That's My Job,sad,"I woke up cryin' late at night - when I was very young
I had dreamed my father - had passed away and gone
My world revolved around him - I couldn't lie there anymore
So I made my way down the mirrowed hall and tapped upon his door.

And I said, ""Daddy, I'm so afraid!
How would I go on, with you gone that way?
Don't wanna cry anymore
So may I stay with you?""

And he said,
""That's my job, that's what I do
Everything I do is because of you
To keep you safe with me ...
That's my job, you see.""

Later we barely got along - this teenage boy and he
Most of the fights it seems - were over different dreams
We each held for me ...
He wanted knowledge and learning - I wanted to fly out west
""Said I could make it out there - if I just had the fare
I got half, will you loan me the rest?""

And I said, ""Daddy, I'm so afraid
There's no guarantee in the plans I've made
And if I should fail, who will pay my way back home?""

And he said,
""That's my job, that's what I do
Ev'rything I do is because of you
To keep you safe with me ...
That's my job, you see.""

Every person carves his spot - and fills the hole with life
And I pray someday I might - light as bright as he.

Woke up early one bright fall day - read the tragic news
After all my travels, I settled down - within a mile or two
I make my livin' with words and rhymes - and all the tragedies
Should go into my head and out instead - as bits of poetry.

But I say, ""Daddy I'm so afraid
How will I go on - with you gone this way
How can I come up - with a song to say, ""I love you.""

""That's my job, that's what I do
Ev'rything I do is because of you
To keep you safe with me ...
That's my job, you see.""

""Ev'rything I do is because of you
To keep you safe with me."""

169,ML170,Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds,Oh My Lord,sad,"I thought I'd take a walk today
It's a mistake I sometimes make
My children lay asleep in bed
My wife lay wide-awake
I kissed her softly on the brow
I tried not to make a sound
But with stony eyes she looked at me
And gently squeezed my hand
Call it a premonition, call it a crazy vision
Call it intuition, something learned from mother
But when she looked up at me, I could clearly see
The Sword of Damocles hanging directly above her
Oh Lord Oh my Lord
Oh Lord
How have I offended thee?
Wrap your tender arms around me
Oh Lord Oh Lord
Oh My Lord

They called at me through the fence
They were not making any sense
They claimed that I had lost the plot
Kept saying that I was not
The man I used to be 
They held their babes aloft
Threw marsh mellows at the Security 
And said that I'd grown soft
Call it intuition, call it a creeping suspicion,
But their words of derision meant they hardly knew me
For even I could see in the way they stared at me
The Spear of Destiny sticking right through me
Oh Lord Oh my lord
Oh Lord 
How have I offended thee?
Wrap your tender arms round me
Oh Lord Oh lord
Oh My Lord

Now I'm at the hairdressers
People watch me as they move past
A guy wearing plastic antlers
Presses his bum against the glass
Now I'm down on my hands and knees
And it's so fucking hot!
Someone cries, ""What are you looking for?""
I scream, ""The plot, the plot!""
I grab my telephone, I call my wife at home
She screams, ""Leave us alone!"" I say, ""Hey, it's only me""
The hairdresser with his scissors, he holds up the mirror
I look back and shiver; I can't even believe what I can see

Be mindful of the prayers you send
Pray hard but pray with care
For the tears that you are crying now
Are just your answered prayers
The ladders of life that we scale merrily
Move mysteriously around
So that when you think you're climbing up, man
In fact you're climbing down
Into the hollows of glamour, where with spikes and hammer
With telescopic camera, they chose to turn the screw
Oh I hate them, Ma! Oh I hate them, Pa!
Oh I hate them all for what they went and done to you
Oh Lord Oh my Lord
Oh Lord
How have I offended thee?
Wrap your tender arms round me
Oh Lord Oh Lord

And I hope the rising black smoke carries me far away
And I never come back to this town again

A ghost waiting its turn
Now I can see right through
It's a warning that nobody heard

It will teach you to love what you're afraid of
After it takes away all that
You learn to love
But you don't
Always
Have to hold your head
Higher than your heart

You better hope you're not alone
You better hope you're not alone
You better hope you're not alone
You better hope you're not alone
You better hope you're not alone
You better hope you're not alone
You better hope you're not alone
You better be hoping you're not so...

Hope you're not alone
Hmm hmm humm

Your -
Your echo comes back out of tune
Now you can probably get used to
Reverb is just a room
The problem is that there's no truth
It fading way too soon
The shadow is on the move
And maybe you should be moving too
Before it takes away all that you learned to love
It will defeat you and then teach you to get back up
Cause you don't
Always
Have to hold your head
Higher than your heart

You better hope you're not alone
You better hope you're not alone
You better hope you're not alone
You better be hoping you're not alone
You better hope you're not alone
You better hope you're not alone
You better hope you're not alone
You better hope you're not so...

Walking out of his room with mirrors, afraid

To try and scrape away the tracks that marked me
Slammed my face into walls of concrete

Carved my cure with the blade that left me in scars

One last goodbye, he was blinded by love

Got tired of whining
A grander scheme with silver lining
For every boy and girl

For all that's wrong with this world

Like little bombs

That drives them off
And leaves again

Life just kind of empties out
Less a deluge than a drought
Less a giant mushroom cloud
Than an unexploded shell
Inside a cell

Found a notice on my door
While outside, the sun is shining on

When you're drunk and the kids look impossibly tanned
You think over and over ""Hey, I'm finally dead""

You can turn it on yourself, you ridiculous clown
You forget what you meant when you read what you said
And, yeah, we knew you were tired but then where are your friends tonight?

Watching the briars grow.

Eliminate the poor

Getting rid

Lock it up, break it down, how much more can we take?

Fight for freedom
Fight authority
Fight for anything
My country 'tis of me

Cry for absolution
It's not the end for me
A last-minute pardon
One final reprieve
Resist the war machine
Don't get in its path
Fight to die a free man
And reap the aftermath

Caving in
Our will to live
Getting rid

They're cued to sway
Forever by the forces of the Lord's choreography
Just for a second the combination of sights, sounds around him
Sends him hurtling back to the mirror of all of his teenager thoughts and fears
He passes big houses and family cars
They saddled the horses in cobblestone yards
He catches the moon looking down from the stars
Just like it's done for years and years
Perpetual feeling in the grown up world that's all 
Around him
That there's secrets that could be revealed with knowledge and philosophy
And Oh to be dumb, Oh to be smart
He might be nursing a broken heart
But feeling this way he's just playing a part
That's been around for centuries

 Excerpt from Psalm 22

 Many bulls have compassed me;
 Strong bulls of Bã'-shân have beset me round.
 They gape upon me with their mouths,
 As a ravening and roaring lion.
 But thou, O Lord, shall bring them down,
 Thou shalt bring them down into the pit of destruction
 Greedy deceitful men shall be exposed as vermin
 And their days as iniquity.

 Excerpt from Psalms 58 and 59

 Deliver me from mine enemies, O my God:
 Deliver me from the workers of iniquity, and
 Save me from bloody men.
 For lo, they lie and wait for my soul:
 The mighty are gathered up against me;
 Not for my transgressions, not for my sin, O Lord.
 They run and prepare themselves without my fault:
 Awake to help me and behold.
 Swords are in their lips: for who, say they, doth hear?
 But thou, O Lord, shall laugh at them. The God
 Of my mercy shall let me see my desire upon mine enemies.
 And at evening let them return, and let them
 Make a noise like a dog, and go round about
 The city. Let them walk up and down for meat, and
 Grudge if they be not satisfied.
 Break out the great teeth of the
 Young lions, o lord and when he
 Bendeth his bow to shoot his
 Arrows, let them be cut in pieces!
 Bring them down, O Lord, our shield.

 Text by Diamanda Galas

 The Devil is an impotent man
 He says it nice and plays himself off as the friend
 He tries to make you uncertain
 So your hands shake
 And then he tells you you're insane
 When you call him by his rightful name:
 Impotent homophobe and coward!
 So you will miss when you aim at this evil man
 Who cannot get it up
 Except
 In the T. V. public operating room of another man's misfortune"

You carry through, you make me smile.
If it were you and me tonight,
I would tame the stars and save the brightest one for you,

If you ever had the chance,
Would you make your life seem right?
Or would you only hold it back,
The good times, the hard, and the bad.
Whatever you say is alright,
Just as long as there's no doubt.
Could you look me in the eyes
And say hopes died

244,ML245,"""Weird Al"" Yankovic",The Night Santa Went Crazy,happy,"Down in the workshop all the elves were makin' toys
For the good Gentile girls and the good Gentile boys
When the boss busted in, nearly scared 'em half to death
Had a rifle in his hands and cheap whiskey on his breath
From his beard to his boots he was covered with ammo
Like a big fat drunk disgruntled Yuletide Rambo
And he smiled as he said, with a twinkle in his eye,
""Merry Christmas to all - now you're all gonna die!""

The night Santa went crazy
The night St. Nick went insane
Realized he'd been gettin' a raw deal
Something finally must have snapped in his brain

Well the workshop is gone now, he decided to bomb it
Everywhere you'll find pieces of Cupid and Comet
Then he tied up his helpers and he held the elves hostage
And he ground up poor Rudolph into reindeer sausage
He got Dancer and Prancer with an old German Luger
And he slashed up Dasher just like Freddy Krueger
And he picked up a flamethrower and he barbecued Blitzen
And he took a big bite and said ""It tastes just like chicken!""

The night Santa went crazy
The night Kris Kringle went nuts
Now you can't hardly walk around the North Pole
Without steppin' in reindeer guts

There's the National Guard and the F.B.I.
There's a van from the Eyewitness News and helicopters circlin' 'round in the sky
And the bullets are flyin', the body count's risin' and everyone's dyin' to know, oh Santa, why?
My my my my my my
You used to be such a jolly guy.

Yes, Virginia, now Santa's doing time
In a federal prison for his infamous crime
Hey, little friend, now don't you cry no more tears
He'll be out with good behavior in 700 more years
But now Vixen's in therapy and Donner's still nervous
And the elves all got jobs working for the postal service
And they say Mrs. Claus, she's on the phone every night
With her lawyer negotiating the movie rights

They're talkin' bout - the night Santa went crazy
The night St. Nicholas flipped
Broke his back for some milk and cookies
Sounds to me like he was tired of gettin' gypped

Wo, the night Santa went crazy
The night St. Nick went insane
Realized he'd been gettin' a raw deal
Something finally must have snapped in his brain
Wo, something finally must have snapped in his brain
Tell ya, something finally must have snapped... in his brain"

They would push till they couldn't skate no more
Office buildin lobbies wasn't safe no more
And it wasn't like they wasn't gettin chased no more
Just the freedom was better than breathin they said
An escape route they used to escape out
When things got crazy they needed to break out
They'd head to any place with stairs
Any good grinds, the world was theirs, uh
And they four wheels would take 'em there
Until the cops came and said, ""There's no skatin here""

And so they kick push kick push kick push kick push coast

Cars with shiny chrome

266,ML267,Dolores Keane,Never Be the Sun,relaxed,"You'll never be the sun turning in the sky
And you won't be the moon above us on the moonlit night
And you won't be the stars in heaven although they burn so bright
But even on the deepest ocean you will be the light

You may not always shine as you go barefoot over stones
You might be so long together or you might walk alone
And you'll find that love comes easy
Or that love is always right
So even when the storm clouds gather you will be the light

And if you lose a parting side when love turns round on you
Leaving the past behind is knowing you'll do like you always
Holding you blind
Keeping you true

You'll never be the sun turning in the sky
And you won't be the moon above us on the moonlit night
And you won't be the stars in heaven although they burn so bright
But even on the deepest ocean you will be the light
You will be the light
You will be the light"

Check it 'cause I think not when this hip-hops like proper
Rhymes be the proof while I'm drinkin' 90 proof
Huh vodka, no OJ, no straw
When you give it to me aiy, give it to me raw
I've learned when you drink Absolut straight it burns
Enough to give my chest hairs a perm
I don't need a chemical blow to pull a hoe
All I need is Chemical Bank to pay da mo'

Northern spicy brown mustard hoes

You can return those stars back to the skies, the world needs them more.

I bet you never thought it could be that bad, that nothing else could bring you back,
But when the world was cold and black, you got by, and you survived.

They say it gets easier at the end of everyday, so why do I wake up with tears?
You can turn a phrase 10million ways, and still it won't be true.

Love is gravity with a pull that you can't deny, that's why you're always falling.
But when you hit the ground you can't stay down, your life is calling.

I bet you never thought it could be that bad, that nothing else could bring you back,

Where the street fold round and the motors start
And the idiot wields the power
Where the chosen hold the highest card
On the field of honour where the ground is hard
So the highest hand is joking wild
And the house soon fold and no one stand

The tower, the moon, the gun, and
Nine nine nine, singer down
Cloudburst and all around
The first are last, the blessed get wired
The best is yet to come
I put my finger on and fired

And the meek'll inherit what they damn well please
Get ahead, go figure, go ahead and pull the trigger

285,ML286,Franz Ferdinand,Jackie Jackson,happy,"Well, Jackie Jackson was a greedy boy
That's right, he liked to stuff his face
The thing that gave that boy the greatest joy
Was eating far too many cakes

And he ate one, two, three, four
But Jackie wanted more
Five, six, seven, eight, Jackie had another plate
And by the time he got to twenty
Anybody woulda thought that he'd had plenty

But he had another eight which
Which makes it twenty-eight
So when he got to twenty-eight
He stopped

He stopped eating cakes
But only because
He'd run out of cakes

But Jackie Jackson was a greedy boy
Yes, he said, ""I've not had enough
I think that I could eat a thousand cakes
Then I could eat a thousand more""

""Because, because I love the taste of tasty cakes
I think I'll find myself some more""

And he did
He went down to the local shop
Where there were loads of cakes
Loads of cakes

So he ate one, two, three, four, five and six
Well, Jackie was a little bit sick
And didn't stop when he got to eight
And said, ""I love the taste of cakes""

""I love the taste of cakes, that's right
I'll eat all day and I'll eat all night""
And one, two, three, four
Jackie had a little bit more

At seventeen he said, ""I need to eat
Until the shop is clean
And cakes, and all the cakes
Pass through my mouth""

""I munch up a banana
I munched up cakes
Into my large expanding gut
My large expanding gut""

And he did, he ate thirty-two cakes in that shop and
Ah, he'd already eaten twenty-eight cakes
Twenty-eight and thirty-two, that means he'd eaten sixty cakes
And, well, do you think that
Jackie Jackson's had eaten enough cakes?

Well, Jackie was a greedy boy
He said, ""I'll never have enough""
He ate ten, twenty, thirty, forty

Jackie said he'd never thought he'd get to eat
So many tasty cakes and ate another eighty
Jackie gave a little moan
His stomach gave a little groan

Jackie yelled and cried, ""Oh, no
I think my belly's overloaded, my belly's overloaded
My belly's overloaded, my belly's overloaded
My belly's overloaded""
Bang

Jackie exploded
He'd eaten over two hundred
Two hundred, two hundred cakes
He'd eaten two hundred cakes and Jackie Jackson?

Well, Jackie was dead"

314,ML315,Brooks & Dunn,Neon Moon,sad,"When the sun goes down
On my side of town
That lonesome feeling
Comes to my door
The whole world turns blue

There's a rundown bar
Cross the railroad tracks
I've got a table for two
Way in the back
Where I sit alone
And think of losing you

I spend most every night
Beneath the light
Of a neon moon

If you lose your one and only
There's always room here for the lonely
To watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon

I think of two young lovers
Running wild and free
I close my eyes
And sometimes see
You in the shadows
Of this smoke-filled room

No telling how many tears
I've sat here and cried
Or how many lies
That I've lied
Telling my poor heart
She'll come back someday
Oh, but I'll be alright
As long as there's light
From a neon moon

If you lose your one and only
There's always room here for the lonely
To watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon

The jukebox plays on
Drink by drink
And the words of every sad song
Seem to say what I think
And this hurt inside of me
Ain't never gonna end

Oh, but I'll be alright
As long as there's light
From a neon moon

If you lose your one and only
There's always room here for the lonely
To watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon

To watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon

To watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon"

I hope you found someone to love you like I tried to
But never could

To get involved with you
But I never thought that you would fall so fast
Got me to thinking, ""What the hell am I gonna do?""

But now you seem like you're fine
Like you've moved on with your life
But I'd give anything to talk to you
And tell you I know I didn't treat you right

I'm sorry for your tears
I'm sorry, I never told you in all of these years
I didn't leave you like I should

Falling from an altercation, you're put in a situation
Denied access to the one thing bound to stop you going under

The narrow street, never ending narrow
Clogs my throat

Silently I try,
Try to walk, blinded by the pitch
The narrow darkness, clogs the street

I am speechless

Fear puts a rush on my steps

332,ML333,Voxtrot,Sway,sad,"I can take a road
Takes a little longer
Walk before the house where we had our games
Suffering life, play, making, we discovered fire

People like you made me so much stronger
People like you made me question blame
Huddled in strength like birds on a sloping wire

Hearing your voice makes me so uneasy
Hearing your voice makes me question fame
Money is deaf to the sound of a lover's cry

The language of loss made me so much older
The language of loss made me lose my grip
The language of loss made me silent as a newborn child

'Cause everything moves in a shifting cycle
The unison soars and the pressure dips
Making our way steadfast in the skyward mile

And baby I know I will see you someday
Building your house on the very street
You severed your mother's life from your father's land

Finish your home we can join them this way
We talked about peace and a little dream
Marriage and love and divorce we don't understand

And you know I have to sway my leaves and branches slowly
Out in the sun, like the silent shout of youth

And we ask why do we take these leaps and chances
Because we have no choice but to wither into truth

And I dreamed you were there
All the vital signs were standing
When I dreamed you were with me
With the summer at my back

And I dreamed you were there
So complete and undemanding
We know the love that gives
Is what the living always lack

And you know I have to sway my leaves and branches slowly
Out in the sun, like the silent shout of youth

And we ask why do we take these leaps and chances
Because we have no choice but to wither into truth"

The boys would laugh and tease about my black feet
They'd tell stories that would warm my soul
Motorbikes and chrome
Jimmy could not wait to get home

Homebird sing
Fly me high on an angel's wing
Homebird sing
Leave out nothing, tell me everything

Everywhere we went just looked the same to me
The skies were blue and the grass was green
I wonder how different I might see them now
Yet I see them somehow

Through the fallen memories when that angel baby signs
Oh, the little magic that his solo brings
Making up songs and words and singin' from the soul
Oh, the stories told
None but him and Jimmy could know

Homebird sing
Fly me high on an angel's wing

Leave out nothing, tell me everything

Why'd you run? Did you hide?
Why'd you leave, no goodbye?
When the clouds take the sky
Does a storm give you life?

Everyone is saying that you should lie down

Hide your ribbons, hide your bows
Hide your coloured cotton gloves
Hide your trinkets, hide your treasures
Hide your neatly scissored locks
Hide your memories, hide them all
Stuff them in a cardboard box
Or throw them into the street below
Leave them to the wind and the rain and the snow
For you might think I'm crazy
But I'm still in love with you

Call me up, baby, and I will answer your call
Call me up but remember I am no use to you at all

Now, you're standing at the top of the stairs
One hand on the banister, a flower in your hair
The other one resting on your hip
Without a solitary care
I fall to sleep in the summer rain
With no single memory of pain
And you might think I'm crazy

I want to spend each moment of the day with you
Oh, look what has happened with just one kiss
I never knew that I could be in love like this
It's crazy but it's true
I only want to be with you

You stopped and smiled at me
And asked if I'd care to dance
I fell into your open arms
And I didn't stand a chance

Now listen, honey
I just want to be beside you everywhere

I guess.
It's what I asked for, it's what I needed.
Well, you know me better than that, or at least you did and something happened.
But once again something's happened.
The confidence you held in us is the rope we almost hung ourselves with.
At times I wonder if we really took the steps to break right through it.
I know that there were better days, but to see the light and to feel the rays.
Life was always back and forth and we were idling or making useless ruckus.

Waiting for the rain to stop.
Destination: beautiful.
Seems that I'm still waiting for the sun.
Someday will come back to us,
If you're willing let it go.
Why won't you just let this be your sun?
It seems like yesterday we had the world our way.
But some say we're headed for destruction.

I'll ask you
What in the world should we do?
The light is green our break is through.
Are we not trying or are we trying to hard?
Well, you know I never want to miss,
I hold on tight and reminisce.
But it's bittersweet to me.
When time stands still as it's trapped inside the letterbox you gave back to me.
But I'm the one who keeps on reading... reading
But I'm the one who wants to let it go.
I'm the first to speak.
You're the last to know.
Another scene that we're creating,
I need to know if we're still making useless ruckus.

Waiting for the rain to stop.

Reveal a bite, skin tightening

We took the tale so lightly
Snows are so far, and lost stars lightening
To enter scorned and tramples tightening"

Tonight...

Regular exercise at the gym, three days a week

At ease, eating well
No more microwave dinners and saturated fats
A patient better driver
A safer car, baby smiling in backseat
Sleeping well, no bad dreams

No paranoia, careful to all animals
Never washing spiders down the plughole
Keep in contact with old friends
Enjoy a drink now and then

Will frequently check credit at moral bank hole in wall
Favours for favours, fond but not in love
Charity standing orders, on Sundays ring road supermarket
No killing moths or putting boiling water on the ants

Car wash also on Sundays
No longer afraid of the dark or midday shadows
Nothing so ridiculously teenage and desperate, nothing so childish
At a better pace, slower and more calculated

No chance of escape, now self-employed
Concerned but powerless
An empowered and informed member of society
Pragmatism not idealism

Will not cry in public, less chance of illness
Tyres that grip in the wet, shot of baby strapped in backseat, a good memory
Still cries at a good film, still kisses with saliva
No longer empty and frantic

Like a cat tied to a stick that's driven into frozen winter shit
The ability to laugh at weakness
Calm, fitter, healthier and more productive

Sometimes I see a narrow flash of light
Sometimes I look and you show me the way

Down the length of the evening to the carnival side
In a house where regret is a carousel ride
We are spinning and spinning and spinning and now

There's a hole in the ceiling down through which I fell
And there's a girl in a basement coming out of her shell
And there are people who will say that they knew me so well
I may not go to heaven, I hope you go to hell

Yeah but the comet is coming between

A monkey needs to dance, so do you

We're the people, the lucky with the fragile bones
The ones who sit and worry about getting to old
You're the monkey in the jungle trying to find your place
The one who let the sunset bring a silly kind of smile on your face

But you, and you, and you, and you
You're just a animal developed into
You, and you, and you, and you
A monkey needs to dance, so do you

You like to do it as a child on your own
You're in the jungle and the monkeys
Take your mind from your home
How many times do they have to tell you
That it's perfectly fine for you to dance around
Naked when you're all by yourself

Cause you, and you, and you, and you
You're just a animal developed into
You, and you, and you, and you
A monkey needs to dance, so do you

Breaks down the defense

My tasks complete the bitch's soul
Lies raped in demonic lust

Her stomach bursts the casket breaks
The seed has taken form
A writhing shape of twisted flesh
The Devil's child is thrown

Hungry for the smell of Death
He rules forbidden evil
Vengeance with a frenzied hatred
The bastard now must die

Lost souls of the dead
Form legions that burst through Hell's Gates
Death of one sacrifice
To avenge the raped corpse from the grave
Blood of one mortal man
The fire grows stronger within
Fate of a frenzied lust
Lucifer takes my dark soul

Down to the fiery pits of Hell
Down to the fiery pits of HELL"

Been hurt in some kind of love affair
And how many times did you swear
That you'd never love again
How many lonely sleepless nights
How many lies, how many fights
And why would you want to
Put yourself through all of that again

Love is pain, I hear you say
Love is a cruel and bitter way of
Paying you back for all the faith you ever had in your brain
How could it be that what you need the most
Can leave you feeling just like a ghost
You never want to feel so sad and lost again

One day you could be looking
Through an old book in rainy weather
You see a picture of her smiling at you
When you were still together
You could be walking down the street
And who should you chance to meet
But that same old smile you've been thinking of all day

Why don't we turn the clock to zero, honey
I'll sell the stock, we'll spend all the money
We're starting up a brand new day

Turn the clock all the way back
I wonder if she'll take me back
I'm thinking in a brand new way

Turn the clock to zero, sister
You'll never know how much I missed her
Starting up a brand new day

Turn the clock to zero, boss

Just like it happened to me
There is simply no immunity
There's no guarantee
I say love is such a force if you find yourself in it
You need some time for reflection
You say, baby wait a minute, wait a minute
Wait a minute, wait a minute
Wait a minute, wait a minute

Turn the clock to zero, honey
I'll sell the stock, we'll spend all the money

I'm begging her to take me back
I'm thinking in a brand new way

Starting up a brand new day

Turn the clock to zero, buddy
Don't wanna be no fuddy-duddy
We're starting up a brand new day

I'm the rhythm in your tune
I'm the sun and you're the moon
I'm the bat and you're the cave
You're the beach and I'm the wave
I'm the plough and you're the land
You're the glove and I'm the hand
I'm the train and you're the station
I'm the flagpole to your nation

I'm the present to your future
You're the wound and I'm the suture
You're the magnet to my pole
I'm the devil in your soul
You're the pupil, I'm the teacher
You're the church and I'm the preacher
You're the flower, I'm the rain
You're the tunnel, I'm the train

Stand up, all you lovers in the world
Stand up and be counted, every boy and every girl
Stand up, all you lovers in the world
We're starting up a brand new day

You're the crop to my rotation
You're the sum of my equation
I'm the answer to your question
If you follow my suggestion
We could turn this ship around
And go up instead of down
You're the pan and I'm the handle
You're the flame and I'm the candle

Et pour toi, et pour moi

Quando sei qui con me

Ma alberi, alberi infiniti
E quando tu sei vicino a me
Questo soffitto, viola, no
Non esiste più, e vedo il cielo sopra a noi
Che restiamo quì, abbandonati come se
Non ci fosse più niente più niente al mondo
Suona l'armonica, mi sembra un organo
Che canta per te e per me

Ambition in the back of a black car
In a high building there is so much to do
Going home time, a story on the radio

Something small falls out of your mouth and we laugh
A prayer for something better
A prayer for something better
Please love me, meet my mother
But the fear takes hold
Creeping up the stairs in the dark, waiting for the death blow
Waiting for the death blow
Waiting for the death blow

Stroking your hair as the patriots are shot
Fighting for freedom on the television
Sharing the world with slaughtered pigs
Have we got everything? She struggles to get away
The pain and the creeping feeling, a little black haired girl
Waiting for Saturday, the death of her father pushing her
Pushing her white face into the mirror
Aching inside me and turn me round, just like the old days
Just like the old days
Just like the old days
Just like the old days

Caressing an old man and painting a lifeless face
Just a piece of new meat in a clean room
The soldiers close in under a yellow moon
All shadows and deliverance, under a black flag
A hundred years of blood, crimson, the ribbon tightens round my throat
I open my mouth and my head bursts open
A sound like a tiger, thrashing in the water, thrashing in the water
Over and over, we die one after the other
Over and over, we die one after the other
One after the other
One after the other
One after the other
One after the other

I got to start to thinking, and seeing things so clear.
'Cause now how could I forget what she left?
What happened in November is what I needed.
And I'm sorry that it shows, but life ain't so bad you know?

And now the sky is such a sweet blue,
And you made this come true,
And my heart feels so new.
(Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa, whoa, whoa-oh)
It's now wonderful to see beautiful views
Like skies that are so blue.
(Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa, whoa, whoa-oh)

I'll never leave this you know.

I'd turn it off for this.
It looks like we got what we wished.
It snowed in Texas but you missed (first time since '86)
And I can't stop thinking how wonderful this is.
And I'm sorry I sound glad, but why always be so sad?

And now the sky is such a sweet blue,
And you made this come true,
And my heart feels so new.
(Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa, whoa, whoa-oh)
It's now wonderful to see beautiful views
Like skies that are so blue.
(Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa, whoa, whoa-oh)

And I know that sometimes oh I might feel alone, so broke, and cold.
But now I'll show that I know
That the sky is such a sweet blue,
And you made this come true,
And my heart feels so new.

420,ML421,Pulp,The Fear,sad,"This is our music from the bachelor's den;
The sound of lonliness turned up to ten;
A horror soundtrack, from a stagnant waterbed
And it sounds just like this

This is the sound of someone losing the plot
Making out that they're ok when they're not
You're gonna like it but not a lot
And the chorus goes like this

Oh baby here comes the fear again
The end is near again
A monkey's built a house on your back;
You can't get anyone to come in the sack
And here comes another panic attack oh
Here we go again

So now you know the words to my song
Pretty soon you'll all be singing along
When you're sad when you're lonely and it all turns out wrong
When you've got the fear

And when you're no longer searching for beauty or love
Just some kind of life with the edges taken off
When you can't even define what it is that you are frightened of
This song will be here

Oh baby here comes the fear again
The end is near again

If you ever get that chimp off your back
If you ever find the thing that you lack
Oh you know you're only having a laugh oh
Oh here we go again
Until the end
Until the end"

Wipe the tears down from your eyes
Take my hand
Hold back pride - goodbye suicide

Goodbye suicide
Not for real but for this life
Au-revoir
Auf-wiedersein - goodbye suicide

Goodbye suicide
Never thought I'd tell a lie
See you later
Sianara- goodbye suicide

Goodbye suicide
Beautiful to be so kind
Forever been
But never seen - goodbye suicide

If the ending fits the words
If you struggle to be heard
You can only try so hard
You can only try so fucking hard

So goodbye suicide
Innocence is not a crime
Hold back fear
Don't let it near - goodbye suicide"

The race ignore me
I sit here twisted, and it hurts me.
The Son is near
His way made for him
Among the hopes
Ten thousand suffering
Oh how my heart aches
The brilliant stories cascade about me
To be handsome again
Thou art all deformed, and I feel your pain
What I touch with my hand, I touch with my heart.
The affection of stillness
Kiss the hand that blesses me
And as the panting ceased
My blood runs now fierce
This when I was young, before I knew nothing
Now I'm the hunted, for the guilt that stains my hands."

They work real hard
Lifting three times their mass
And sometimes more

Been tumbling down quick first right from the start
I never learned just get up and go on
Until I'm just knocked right off of my feet

But it's not the fall that hurts
It's when you hit the ground
'Cause it's not the fall that hurts
It's when you hit the ground

Stumblin' with every step I take
And it seems I can't get a grip
I'm soon gonna slip
And then I look down
I see the fur ground
Is closening fast again
And then boom

But it's not the fall that hurts
It's when you hit the ground
'Cause it's not the fall that hurts
It's when you hit the ground

It's when you hit the ground
But it's not the fall that hurts
It's when you hit the ground

Inscribe your form, bipedal ""P""
They draw an altar on which
God has slaughtered all stability

And yet to see you all at once we only need the point
Flirting with infinity, your geometric progeny
That fit inside you oh so tight
With triangles that feel so right

The patron saint of imperfection frees us from our sin
And if our transcendental lift should find a final floor
Then Man will know the death of God where wonder was before

Yeah, I know this Pi shit backwards and forwards
Check it out

I did three chicks then I pointed at the door
A girl entered in so that made it four
I snapped one time in came another five
Add 'em all up and that makes nine
The average age 26.5
Now that's what I call gettin' some pi
Five of the chicks wore 6-inch heels
Two of the nine squealed like seals
514 was the area code
Québec, Canada; my winter abode
And my 1.3 million dollar chalet
Pi backwards, pi forwards, all night and all day

Our dreamless bed,
Is mine to keep.
In my dark eyes and frozen arms,
Nothing lives 'cept my harm.
Now you're worn with years.
Years and sorrows.
Like saint with arrows.
Once again, I see a man.
I watch him die with a humble sigh.

Calm this tide, tide of sorrow.
He leads me away and I follow.
Sighs and then slumbers,
Wakes and sighs again.
Opens up the eyes,
Sees the ghost again.
Our dying love, it prays in vain to live,
And pleads for help, I simply cannot give.

My devoted love takes tiny backward
Steps away.
Loneliness aplenty spread before me."

Where have you gone, Marie?
Why did you leave?
Come back to me, cherie
I know you went away
You went away, Marie
You could not stay
You could not stay, cherie

Please stay with me, Marie, cherie

Oh no, he did not treat you right
Your innocence is lost
You never had the chance to fly
She looked so pretty like a dream
Her skin's like velvet cream
She never made her sweet sixteen

Nobody came around to see her
It was as if she wasn't there
A lone butterfly that's caught in amber
Always your daddy's little girl

Tell me, where have you gone?
Where have you gone, Marie?
Why did you leave?
Come back to me, cherie

Again you're circling all around,
If you could only touch me now,
Strangers from the past,
Don't hesitate,
Now we're standing face to face,
If heaven is the only place,
Would you take my hand?

Just tell me what do you want from me,
This is love in the first degree,
Tell me why, every time I feel your eyes all over me.

Tell me what do you want from me,
Are you mad enough to see,
That its hard to cross the line,
Come on now, set me free.

What do you want from me.

Get closer now,
Softly whisper in my ear,
Please take me away from here,
Away from all my tears.
It's not too late,
Now we're standing face to face,
And heaven is the only place,
Will you understand?

Just tell me what do you want from me,
This is love in the first degree,
Tell me why every time I feel your eyes all over me.

Tell me what do you want from me,
Are you mad enough to see,
That its hard to cross the line,
Come on now, set me free.

And I know, If you give me this feeling,
I'll be there to hold you tight.
Cauz I'd show, your love is a hero,
We will run, run out of sight.

Live up, live up, live up
I wanna get up
Instead I give up
Sometimes life dictates what we hate

And when the sun runs out
No doubts left standing
Who knows if it'll go our way
And when the sun runs out
No doubts left standing
Isha Allah it'll be okay

And when the sun runs out
No doubts left standing
Would it be different if we knew we would win
Let love slip through our fingers I say

Live up, live up, live up
Sometimes
Even the season's change
All patterns rearrange

Lord, won't you grant me
New eyes, so I can see
What good are songs with no dances
I wanna live to live and take my chances
I wanna live today
Leave inhibitions in the wind
What good are songs with no dances, I pray
Lord, won't you grant me
Won't you grant me
Lord, won't you grant me"
434,ML435,Marillion,The Invisible Man,sad,"The world's gone mad
And I have lost touch
I shouldn't admit it
But I have.
It slipped away while I was distracted
I haven't changed
I swear I haven't changed
How did this happen? I didn't feel myself
Evaporating...

My body has gone
But my eyes remain
Hovering. Witnessing.
Cold as a ghost ...watching the streets
Sheltering in doorways of
Venice, Vienna,
Budapest, Krakow, and Amsterdam

I have become the invisible man

The invisible heart beating against you
The invisible pulse silently thumping

I shout my name in the public places
No one seems to notice
No one understands
I stand perfectly still
In the middle of the road
I hold my nerve
I hold my nerve
Hold my nerve
But the cars don't swerve

I will hear your prayers
As you whisper alone
I am the one you felt was close
Close behind you in St. Stephen
You lit a candle
Blessings in the cold night air

I'll feel your breath as you turn to go
I'll watch you leave
From somewhere up high
As you cross the park
In the Autumn light
In the Autumn light
In the Autumn light

If I close my eyes
I can see where you live
Climb the winding stairs
Up to your apartment
The scent of you preparing
His evening meal
I must watch in dread
When he's cruel to you
In horrified silence
As you make love
I cannot lift a hand
Lift a hand to stop him
I don't exist What can I do?
What can I do?

I will scream in your ear
As you're passing by
I will wrap my arms around you
You won't hear, you won't feel me
I will walk stride for stride with you
I will try to help
When you stumble
You will stumble through me.

I have become the invisible man
It's all I am
Invisible

I have read all your letters
I know what you contain
I have dreamt your dreams
My head...
My head is haunted
I will scream again
""I am perfectly sane""
""I am perfectly sane""
But I am
The invisible man
I am
The invisible man

Talk to me
Acknowledge me
Confide in me
Confess to me ... or
Leave me be
Leave me be."

Well, I'm making it

So tell me baby, can you shake it?
If I can move it with you
Will you let me take it?
I'll be down on my knees
Screaming, ""Take me, take me
Take me, take me - I'm yours""

I've never felt so out of control
You don't even know
What you're doing to me
C'mon and do it to me

And I'm ready to break on through

So I'm tearing down the walls inside
Letting go of all my pride
Making room for the lie
I don't need to hide inside this shell
This shell no more

And I've been going around this bend
So many miles I have roamed
Lately I feel like I'm coming home

In a dream I always talk to you
You seem fine again, my sweet

Flippin' out I try to call to you
Till you come to me
Tell me what to do

And I know it's not the same, there's no blame

And you say it's not true, dear, it's mine to fear

I won't sing to you

Or is it something new?

And you say it's not true, dear, it's mine to fear
-We won't coexist-
Any way you're not the same, it's the blame

Does it come to you?
Are we really through?

Any guy would do this thing for me
It's not much to ask

While the air raid sirens blare

The radio just let us know
That this is not a test

Everywhere the atom bombs are dropping
It's the end of all humanity
No more time for last-minute shopping
It's time to face your final destiny

It's Christmas at ground zero
There's panic in the crowd
We can dodge debris while we trim the tree
Underneath the mushroom cloud

You might hear some reindeer on your rooftop
Or Jack Frost on your windowsill
But if someone's climbing down your chimney
You better load your gun and shoot to kill

It's Christmas at ground zero
And if the radiation level's okay
I'll go out with you and see all the new
Mutations on New Year's Day

It's Christmas at ground zero
Just seconds left to go
I'll duck and cover with my Yuletide lover
Underneath the mistletoe

He oozes down the heating duct
Swims like seaweed down the hall
He briefly digs your wiggy pad
Seeps out through the wall

Liquid light on New York City
Christmas without the chintzy stuff

What exactly does he want
This Rabelaisian puff of smoke
To make you feel all warm and cozy
Like you heard a good joke

Like you heard an Arlen tune
Or bought yourself a crazy hat
Like you had a mango cooler
Ooh, Morph the Cat

Sultan Place, the automat
Players playin' in da Bronx
Respect to Morph the Cat

Kind of like an arctic mindbath
Cool and sweet and slightly rough

So rich is his charisma
You can almost hear it sing
He skims the roofs
And bells begin to ring

Laughing on the grass

Bringing joy to old Manhattan

487,ML488,Tom Lehrer,I Wanna Go Back To Dixie,happy,"Spoken live introduction on Revisited:
Well, what I like to do on formal occasions like this is to take
Some of the various types of songs that we all know and presumably
Love, and, as it were, to kick them when they're down. I find that
If you take the various popular song forms to their logical extremes,
You can arrive at almost anything from the ridiculous to the obscene,
Or - as they say in New York - sophisticated. I'd like to
Illustrate with several hundred examples for you this evening,
First of all, the southern type song about the wonders of the
American south. But it's always seemed to me that most of these
Songs really don't go far enough. The following song, on the other
Hand, goes too far. It's called ""I Wanna Go Back To Dixie.""

I wanna go back to Dixie
Take me back to dear ol' Dixie
That's the only li'l ol' place for li'l ol' me
Ol' times there are not forgotten
Whuppin' slaves and sellin' cotton
And waitin' for the Robert E. Lee
(It was never there on time)
I'll go back to the Swanee
Where pellagra makes you scrawny
And the Honeysuckle clutters up the vine
I really am a-fixin'
To go home and start a-mixin'
Down below that Mason-Dixon line

Oh, poll tax, how I love ya, how I love ya
My dear old poll tax

Won'tcha come with me to Alabammy
Back to the arms of my dear ol' Mammy
Her cookin's lousy and her hands are clammy
But what the hell, it's home
Yes, for paradise the Southland is my nominee
Jes' give me a ham hock and a grit of hominy

I wanna go back to Dixie
I wanna be a dixie pixie
And eat cornpone till it's comin' outta my ears
I wanna talk with Southern gentlemen
And put my white sheet on again,
I ain't seen one good lynchin' in years
The land of the boll weevil
Where the laws are medieval
Is callin' me to come and nevermore roam
I wanna go back to the Southland
That ""y'all"" and ""shet-ma-mouth"" land
Be it ever so decadent
There's no place like home"

The children's laughter sang
Skipping just like the stones they threw
Their voices echoed across the waves
It's getting late

It was just another night
With a sunset and a moonrise
Not so far behind
To give us just enough light
To lay down underneath the stars
We listened to Papa's translations
Of the stories across the sky
We drew our own constellations

The west winds often last too long
And when they calm down
Nothing ever feels the same
Sheltered under the Kamani tree
Waiting for the passing rain
Clouds keep moving to uncover the sea
Of stars up above us chasing the day away
A way to find the stories that we sometimes need
Listen close enough and all else fades
Fades away

It was just another night
With a sunset and a moonrise
Not so far behind
To give us just enough light
To lay down underneath the stars
Listen to all translations
Of the stories across the sky
We drew our own constellations"

My lady gives birth today.
I run to her room right away.
She smiles with glee and hands her to me.
I look at my newborn and say:

Damn, that's a ugly baby!
Damn, that's a ugly-ass baby!
I'm feeling quite concerned,
My semen must have turned,
'Cause, damn, that's a ugly baby.

I can't believe this came from me.
I think her mom did too much LSD.
She's skinny like a twig.
At least her nuts are big...
But the placenta is cuter than she.

Damn, that's a ugly baby!
God damn, that's an ugly-ass baby!
I can't take her home today,
She'll scare the dog away,
'Cause, damn, that's a ugly baby.

And when she smiles, I find,
Shane McGowen comes to mind.
It makes me want to cry
When I look into her good eye.
I always wanted kids;
Is it wrong to hope for SIDS? (audience woos in agreement Fuck you, it's my fuckin' baby!)
Then the doctor calls me in.
""Mr. Lynch, she has a... twin.""

Damn, that's a good-lookin' baby!
One for two on the good-lookin' babies!
I almost start to weep.
Now, this one we can keep,
Cause that was an ugly-ass...

Damn, that's a ugly baby! (C'mon, everybody, sing along!)
Damn, that's an ugly ba- (Sing, fuckers! Come on!)
Damn, that's an ugly baby! (Whoo!)
Damn, that's an ugly baby!

She's got one good tooth, and one ear, and one eye,
And, thank god, just one nose-but it's on her left thigh.
Now, doctor, I am asking you, guy to guy,
Would a really, really, really late-term abortion still fly?
Oh, no! (My baby!) Not me!
I don't want no ugly baby!
I said, damn, that's an ugly baby.
Damn, that's an ugly-ass baby.

Thank you! Goodnight!"

494,ML495,New Model Army,"No Mirror, No Shadow",sad,"It's hard to talk to people who remember what I say
I guess I need an amnesiac priest or something
Or a stranger on a long bus journey to somewhere far away
One day the desert will cover all the earth
With only the wind to sing in the silence
All my secrets buried forever in the blown dust

It seems so simple but they just don't get it
I meant what I said at the time that I said it
Nothing is ever meant to last
I want no mirror, I want no shadow
I want my follies to have no echo
Only the ties to hold on fast

Nobody has their consciences clean
Loyalty in the end will be enough
This family thicker than blood
The way we grew together, roots twisted together
And everybody thinks what they shouldn't think
Everybody does what they shouldn't do
Everybody wants what they shouldn't want
Hold on to me and I'll hold on to you

Maybe I'm wrong but they just don't get it
I meant what I said just at the time that I said it
Nothing is ever meant to last
I want no mirror, I want no shadow
I want my follies to have no echo
Only the ties to hold on fast

We spread our mischief with a little glint in the eye
Where there is war we like to bring peace
Where there is peace we want to bring war
Seduce the priests and break it all
But don't ask me to remember

It seems so simple but they just don't get it"

Jenifer rose and stood over the girl, examining her
Handiwork. Her heart laid motionless beneath her,
Seemingly dead. Her eyesockets dry and empty. Her
Heels and elbows sprayed and bloodied. Some on-lookers
Gasped in horror. Some swooned and fainted
Melodramatically. Most just stared in disbelief.
Jennifer reached down between her thighs and pulled
The crotch of her bathing suit to the side - exposing
Her vagina. The other girl slowly sat up and began
Sliding her fingers into Jennifer. A few minutes
Later, her wrists were in, then her elbows. Eventually
She would completely disappear into her womb. Jennifer
Tilted her head to the side curiously. She heard the
Sound of a rickety-wooden roller-coaster in the
Distance. It's passengers screaming in mob terror. She
Knew that sooner or later they would realize that the
Ride wasn't stopping and they were all going to die..."

Dann kann ich in ihr Zentrum sehn
Nicht daß die Brust das Schöne wär
Ich schwimm ihr einfach hinterher
Funkenstaub fließt aus der Mitte
Ein Feuerwerk springt aus dem Schritt

Feuer und Wasser kommt nicht zusammen
Kann man nicht binden sind nicht verwandt
In funken versunken steh ich in flammen
Und bin im Wasser verbrannt
Im Wasser verbrannt

Wenn sie nackt schwimmt ist das schön
Dann will ich sie von hinten sehn
Nicht daß die Brüste reizvoll wären
Die Beine öffnen sich wie Scheren
Dann leuchtet heiß aus dem versteck
Die Flamme aus dem Schenkeleck

Ja

Sie schwimmt vorbei bemerkt mich nicht
Ich bin ihr Schatten sie steht im licht
Da ist keine Hoffnung und keine Zuversicht denn

Feuer und Wasser kommt nicht zusammen
Kann man nicht binden, sind nicht verwandt
In Funken versunken steh ich in flammen
Und bin im Wasser verbrannt
Im Wasser verbrannt
So kocht das Blut in meinen Lenden
Ich halt sie fest mit nassen Händen
Glatt wie ein fisch und kalt wie Eis
Sie wird sich nicht an mich verschwenden
Ich weiß

Feuer und Wasser kommt nie zusammen
Kann man nicht binden sind nicht verwandt
In Funken versunken steh ich in flammen
Und bin im Wasser verbrannt
Im Wasser verbrannt

Kann man nicht binden, sind nicht verwandt

I saw her face
It was the face that I loved
And I knew I had to run away
And get down on my knees and pray
That they'd go away
But still they'd begin
Needles and pins

I heard somebody fixed today
There was no last goodbyes to say
His will to live ran out
I heard somebody turned to dust
Looking back at what he left
A list of plans and photographs
Songs that never will be sung
These are the things he won't get done
The things he won't get done

I've seen the man use the needle (seen the needle use the man)
I've seen them crawl from the cradle (to the gutter on their hands)
They fight a war but it's fatal (it's so hard to understand)
I've seen the man use the needle (seen the needle use the man)

Just one shot to say goodbye
One last taste to mourn and cry
Cry, cry
Scores and shoots, the lights go dim
Just one shot to do him in
He hangs his head and wonders why
Why the monkey only lies
Lies, lies
But pay the pauper he did choose
He hung his head inside the noose
He hung his head inside the noose

I've seen the man use the needle (seen the needle use the man)
I've seen them crawl from the cradle (to the gutter on their hands)
They fight a war but it's fatal (it's so hard to understand)
I've seen the man use the needle (seen the needle use the man)

Cryptic writing
On the wall (the beginning of the end)
I've seen myself use the needle (seen the needle in my hand)

I've seen the man use the needle (seen the needle use the man)
I've seen them crawl from the cradle (to the gutter on their hands)
They fight a war but it's fatal (it's so hard to understand)
I've seen myself use the needle (seen the needle in my hand)

'Cause I saw the blood seep down to your toes
Turn away if you must but how can you put your trust
In a man who always sleeps in his clothes?

A folded photo in his purse
But if you pin your hopes to his back my dear
I'm afraid the bubble will burst

Wondering if things would ever go right
And if there was a spot up there for me

Strange that it seemed to have my name written in it
I reached for the star and it kissed me with it's light
It made me cast a show that was silver and bright

I never had any real reason
To thank my lucky stars
But now I got a pretty good reason cause

Not positive, who's the best? Pac, Nas and Big
Ain't no best, East, West, North, South, flossed out, greedy
I embrace y'all with napalm
Blows up, no guts, left chest, face gone
How could Nas be garbage?
Semi-autos at your cartilage
Burner at the side of your dome, come outta my throne

To ever trust Venice

And what the tropics can do
I know only too well
So, let's you and me go away
To the Ice Hotel

Heavy clothing at all times
Is the expected norm
Even candlelight at dinner
Is considered too dangerously warm
And when the time comes for us to sleep
We'll spread out our reindeer fleece
And curl up together
On an ice block carved for two
But then in the morning
Provided we've made it through...

We'll step out together
To watch the sun rise over
That vast expanse of cold
And who knows if we're lucky
We may find ourselves talking
Of what the future may hold
This is no whim of the moment
I want you to realize
Let's go away
To that palace made of ice

Let's you and me go away to the Ice Hotel
The Bahamas are all booked out

Ain't it true as the sun that shines
You got yours, and you got mine and that's good
Everybody's just like you - it's true
Everybody wants a good thing, too

Everybody - it's a good thing
Everybody wants a good thing
Everybody - ain't it true that
Everybody's looking for the same thing

Ain't it true there's room for doubt
Maybe some things that you can do without and that's good
Everybody's just like you - it's true
Everybody wants a good thing, too

Now let's have a great big hand for everybody that can understand
Life's a bee without a buzz - it's going great 'til you get stung
Now let's not forget to toast everyone who might've missed the boat
And to everybody else who waits 'til the next one sails in again

Everybody - it's a good thing
Ain't it true - it's a monumental good thing
Everybody - it's a good thing
Ain't it true - it's a monumental good thing
Everybody - it's a good thing
Ain't it true - it's a monumental good thing"

I've heard lots of people say once a man's a killer, they just keep
On killing and killing; they sort of develop a taste for blood.

It's all the same (yes). After all, THEY CAN ONLY HANG YOU ONCE.

Pick up the brew thought I was Michael an'
Mics are writin' pool, now, I'm into Iron Duals
Turn-ons the Earth's whoopee, she out of law school
In hale break beats of hell A-Alikes propel parallel
Duracell night, you flash a burnt cell
Snap out of CandyLand, kids the old rumor is
Blacks become immune to shit, we never did like
Eati' dead birds chose the pharmacy over herbs
Men marryin men, ill they got the herbs pulsar
Scissor hand wig vanished in the winter
Livin' off land you god damn right I fuck fans king me
Check checkmate props like the micro chip founder
Neck to neck stocks with Bill Gates now

When we hug these mics we get busy
Come and have a good time with G-O-D
Make you snap your fingers or wiggle
Scream, shout, laugh and just giggle
Shake that body, party that body
Don't fuck with Ghost you'll feel sorry
That's word, I'm not the herb
Understand what I'm sayin' (echo)

Hit mics like Ted Koppel, rifle expert
Let off the Eiffel, burn a flag in the grass it's spiteful
Ringleader set it off, rap Derek Jeter
Culprit, prince of the game wish you could see us
We lay low glitter wax full bangles
Priceless rolls, lay around the God get tangled
Woolly hair, eyes firey red, feet made of brass
Twelve men, following me, it be the God staff
Move, every script's like Miramax
Smash the big boy totalled it, will shot fear effects
Son beamin' wifee on the beach, sippin' Zima
Wu 'binos, to latinos, we bust Selena
Over night, God schedules, fed ex
Pretty soloette velvet nice DNA scroll genetics
Too hot, to handle one thought scramblin the mandolin
Hundred game Wilt Chamberlain, smack em, say when
He rollin' up, face wrinkled up, hands is on his nuts
Yo kid stop frontin' on the ground before you get touched
It's Canada Dry sess, obsessed with Allah's sun
We want rye, we want it so bad we might cry

Learn. Fortunately it's easy. You'll soon learn.

I told her put an extra layer on!
I know what happens when she drinks Patrón.
Her closet's missing half the things she bought
Yeah, tequila makes her clothes fall off.

She'll start by kicking out of her shoes.
Lose an earring in her drink.
Leave her jacket in the bathroom stall.
Drop a contact down the sink.

Them pantyhose ain't gonna last too long,
If the DJ puts Bon Jovi on.
She might come home in a tablecloth,
Yeah tequila makes her clothes fall off.

Waoh

She can handle any champagne brunch.
A bridal shower with Bacardi punch.
Jello shooters full of Smirnoff,
But tequila makes her clothes fall off.

She'll start by kicking out of her shoes.
Lose an earring in her drink.
Leave her jacket in the bathroom stall.
Drop a contact down the sink.

She don't mean nothing,
She's just having fun.

The apple and the fall of man
The price we pay
So the people say

Down the path of shame it led us
Dare to bite the hand that fed us
Fairy tale the moral end
Wheel of fortune never turns again

Never turns again

The worst of it is come and gone in the chaos of millennium
In the falling out of the doomsday crowd
Their last retreat is moving slow
They burn their bridges as they go
The heretic is beautified
He'll teach the harlot's child to smile

Wracked again by indecision
Should we make that small incision
Testify to the bleeding heart inside?
We cut, we scratched
We ran, we slashed
And when he opened up at last
Found a cul-de-sac
Deep and black
Of smoke and ash

The wicked king of parody
Is kissing all his enemies
On the seventh day
Of the seventh week
The tyrant's voice is softer now
But just for one forgiving hour
Before the rise of his
Iron fist again
Fist again

I've come tonight
I've come to know
The way we are
The way we'll go
Come to measure this
The width of the wide abyss

I come to you in restless sleep
Where all your dreams turn bittersweet
With voodoo doll philosophies
And day-glow holy trinities

The crooked raft that leaves the shore
Ferries drunken souls aboard
Pilgrims march to Compostela
Visions of their saint in yellow

All follow deep in trance
Lost in a catatonic dance
Know no future
Damn the past
Blind, warm, ecstatic
Safe at last..."

Waitin' for a sprinkle genie to come and drink it up

For the sake of conversation we'll call you the brand new heavy 
You're a mix between an Ugnaut and Eugene Levy 
You can call it big-boned I'd prefer to call it gut 
You're Buddha you're Shamu you're Jabba the fuckin' Hutt 
You had harpoon scars and your boobies were hairy 
I smelt tuna melt but I wasn't gonna worry 
It was 3:00 A.M. and I wasn't gettin' squat
So I rolled you up in flour and aimed it for the wet spot 
I was buttering rolls like a soup kitchen Christian 
Then it hit me somethin' bit me while my little rod was fishing 
I was deep sea fishin' I took a fat chance 
But how was I supposed to know that Jabberjaws lived in your pants? 
At that junction I came to realize 
That only Frank Perdue likes thighs that size 
Fatty fatty boom ba latty I gotta lament 
That you were not a girl you were an experiment 

'Cause you're pretty when I'm drunk 
You're pretty when I'm drunk 
You're pretty when I'm drunk 
You're pretty when I'm drunk 
You're pretty when I'm drunk 
You're pretty when I'm drunk

Poke fun at my incompetence, doesn't make that much sense
My qualification shrinks as I'm getting old
As I'm getting old, as I'm getting older
All the while:

Love seems to be on my mind
Seems to be all the time
This is the way I always start my songs
Singing and swinging along
Singing and swinging along

Oh no, that anonymous feeling is true
So vague and pale, that blue
Spending all my quality time with the TV
Is the last thing I should do, it's the last thing I should do

So long for respectable thoughts I roam
Plus forty four long distance call
Making me wish I was not here at home
Now tell me all about Rome, tell me all about Rome

Love seems to be on my mind
Seems to be all the time
Oh what a lovely way to spend your life
Not needing anything
Just walk around and sing

I took a train, I took a plane
I had to get out of this place and find my love
Where had she gone?
She was lost in all this stress
Why must I work
When I just can travel the world and have fun?
I'm a young boy with a lot of things on my mind

Love seems to be on my mind
Seems to be all the time
This is the way I always end my songs
Singing and swinging along

Consider well and bear in mind
What our good God for us has done,
In sending His beloved Son.
With Mary holy we should pray
To God with love this Christmas Day:
In Bethlehem upon that morn
There was a blessed Messiah born.

Near Bethlehem did shepherds keep
Their flocks of lambs and feeding sheep;
To whom God's angels did appear,
Which put the shepherds in great fear.
""Arise and go,"" the angels said,
""To Bethlehem, be not afraid;
For there you'll find, this happy morn,
A princely Babe, sweet Jesus born.""

With thankful heart and joyful mind,
The shepherds went the Babe to find,
And as God's angel had foretold,
They did our Saviour Christ behold.
Within a manger He was laid,
And by his side the Virgin Maid,
As long foretold upon that morn, 
There was a blessed Messiah born"

I will rearrange my plans
And change for you.

If I could go back
That's the first thing I would do
I swear that I would
Do my best to follow through,
Come up with a master plan,
A homerun hit, a winning stand
A guarantee, and not promise
That I'd never let your love slip
From my hands.

If it's the beaches,
If it's the beaches, sands you want,
Then you will have them.
If it's the mountains, bending rivers
Then you will have them.
If it's a wish to run away,

While I go gas up the truck.
Pack the old love letters up.

Far from depths where secrets lie

Held my breath
But that moment's gone
First time I felt
Life somewhat hurts
I need an option, a reason, and some hope

Yell at me, I want to be your light that shines
But my ground is shaking and I might fall
I wish that I could say

This night under stars, well I call it peace

Where've you been?
I've looked for you forever and a day
Where've you been?

And she became a salesman's wife
He was home each night by eight
But one stormy evening he was late
Her frightened tears fell to the floor
Until his key turned in the door

Where've you been?
I've looked for you forever and a day
Where've you been?
I'm just not myself when you're away

They'd never spent a night apart
For sixty years she heard him snore
Now they're in a hospital
In separate beds on different floors

Claire soon lost her memory
Forgot the names of family
She never spoke a word again
Then, one day, they wheeled him in
He held her hand and stroked her head
In a fragile voice, she said

And bring 'em back to the pad out by da woods
You know the crew bring the bad outta da good
And I'm usually not layin' in the boozy spots
Girl, we can blow quicker than oozi shots
Chill where da Cristal's cold jacuzzi's hot, ya feel?

(Black Buddafly:)
I ain't really the kinda girl that would
Say that I'm a bad girl, though I should
So many times I did whatever was right
But ended up in pain and that's why I'm like
I still believe and I'm hopin'
That I will find real love
But right now is not the time for that
'Cause I'm young and I'm bad, and I like that

Do you feel me now
Dance with me now
Ladies, help me out

Ay, if you feel me
Move wit me and don't stop
Put your hands up
Soon as the beat drops
'Cause usually, I'm like this but tonight
I'm a bad girl
I'm a bad girl
And tonight we gonna show you how we get down

Don't think I'm innocent
Might look like that outside but when
I be alone wit you, you'll see different
'Cause all those boys dig those crazy things
I like it so good and so deep
Like I said, put me straight to sleep
Don't get me wrong, because I'm not a hoe
I tell when to stop and where to go

Do you feel me now
Dance with me now
Ladies help me out, what

Ay, if you feel me
Move wit me and don't stop
Put your hands up
Soon as the beat drops
'Cause usually, I'm like this but tonight
I'm a bad girl
I'm a bad girl
And tonight we gonna show you how we get down

Move wit me and don't stop
Put your hands up
Soon as the beat drops
'Cause usually, I'm like this but tonight
I'm a bad girl
I'm a bad girl
And tonight we gonna show you how we get down

(Fabolous:)
Once a good girl gone bad, she's gone forever
Prolly with me, enjoying California weather
Hey Mami, we belong together
Like the white and yellow stones that set into the prom together
And now a girl get into a stressed out mood
And go bad faster than left out food
They say it's the lazy flow the shorties love
It drive 'em crazy, though, like Courtney Love
I keep a bad one that's also's a good cook
Fifth Ave. classy mixed with da hood look
And my good look them bad for yo health
And everybody know you can do bad by yourself, girl

(Black Buddafly:)
Ay, if you feel me
Move wit me and don't stop
Put your hands up
Soon as the beat drops
'Cause usually, I'm like this but tonight

And tonight we gonna show you how we get down

Do you feel me now
Dance with me now

Ooh...
How - how can it be that a love
Carved out of caring fashioned by fate
Could suffer so hard
From the games played once too often
But making mistakes is a part
Of life's imperfections born of the years
Is it so wrong to be human after all

Drawn into the stream
Of undefined illusion
Those diamond dreams
They can't disguise the truth
That there is something about you
Baby so right
I wouldn't be without you baby tonight

If ever our love was concealed
No one can say that we didn't feel
A million things
And a perfect dream of life
Gone, fragile but free
We remain tender together
If not so in love
It's not so wrong
We're only human after all

These changing years
They add to your confusion
Oh and you need to hear the time
That told the truth
That there's something about you
Baby so right
I couldn't live without you
Baby tonight

Ooh...
Ooh...

I couldn't live without you

I still believe my ears, but all I hear is lasting silence

Like a disciple of a witness
I judge upon my sacred eye
Still I found the origin
In what's left of me inside

Can I call this my burden
Or is this just my dream to fly?
I would be crying tears of laughter
If I could see me smile again

Weaker, weaker every day
I forgot my urge to fly away

And is my life as bare as it is?
Cold and lonely enough?
Have you achieved what you were longing for?
Sad enough this cannot be undone

I drop my eyes and shiver as I see
The reflection in the mirror of me

Have you given up, my friend?
Forgiveness be mine

Bodies burning in red ashes
On the hill the church in ruin
Is the scene of evil doings

It's a place for all black sinners
Watch them eating dead rats' inners
I guess it's the same
Where ever you may go

Oh, lord yeah

Carrying banners which denounce the Lord
See me rocking in my grave
See them anoint my head with their black blood
See them stick the stake through me

Don't hold me back 'cause I just gotta go
Satan's got a hold on my soul now
Look in my brain and there was blood and seed
Look in my eyes in there I know
Yeah

On the scene a priest appears
Sinners falling at his knees
Satan sends out funeral pyres
Casts the priest into the fire

It's the place for all bad sinners
Watch them eating dead rats' inners
I guess it's the same
Where ever you may go

Evil minds that plot destruction!
Sorceror of death's construction!

In the fields are bodies burning!
As the War Machine keeps turning!
Death and hatred to mankind!
Poisoning their brainwashed minds!

Oh Lord, yeah!

Polititians hide themselves away!
They only started the war!
Why should they go out to fight?
They leave their role to the poor!

Yeah!

Time will tell on their Power Minds!
Making war just for fun!
Treating people just like Pawns in Chess!
Wait till their Judgement Day comes!

Yeah!

Now in dark, this world stops turning!
Ashes were their bodies burning!
No more War Pigs have the Power!

On their knees are War Pigs crawling!
Begging mercy for their sins!

The love our souls had sworn to make
Now I watch the falling rain
All my mind can see now is your

Well, I guess you took my youth
And gave it all away
Like the birth of a new found joy
This love would end in rage

And when she died, I couldn't cry
The pride within my soul
You left me incomplete
All alone as the memories now unfold

Believe the word
I will unlock my door
And pass the cemetery gates

Sometimes when I'm alone
I wonder aloud
If you're watching over me
Some place far abound

I must reverse my life
I can't live in the past
Then set my soul free
Belong to me at last

Through all those complex years
I thought I was alone
I didn't care to look around
And make this world my own

And when she died, I should've cried
And spared myself some pain
You left me incomplete
All alone as the memories still remain

The way we were
A chance to save my soul
And my concern is now in vain

Believe the word
I will unlock my door
And pass the cemetery gates

And my concern is now in vain

Atone for all you've done

Sealed the spell of my scrawny body
Soil to skin, My next of kin
Damp air grasped, Stole the words
And greeted me with a hiss

This is forgiveness, So I know
Once I repent I seal the lid
I slither for you and I'm dying
I find trust in hate

They wear white for me
Seemingly jaded and lost
I forge myself into your dreams
And here I am your life

Hangman, Clutching at his tools
I will come for you

The noose is tied
Murmur through the crowd
Plunging into anywhere but here

Cloak-captured sighs of relief
As the primal touch brought me back
And the last sight I did see is still here
Beckoning right behind me"

May god have mercy on our dirty little hearts
Shame on us, for all we have done

And you never get to take the easy way

Brought on by our own hand

And at peace
And I guess I just wanted to tell you
As the light starts to fade
That you are the reason
That I am not afraid
And I guess I just wanted to mention
As the heavens will fall
We will be together soon if we
Will be anything at all

Soft like a whisper, she's calling me to her

She took my heart with one look in her eye
To a place that feels like home

It's like a thunderclap 
Feel the prickles running 
Up and down your back 
Why so divine, the pain of love 

You have to work at it, stay with it 
Pay for it, bust your ass 
Lie for it, cheat for it 
Forget about your past 
Why so divine, the pain of love 

You dream of it passionate 
You get a rise from it 
Feel the hot cum 
Dripping on your thighs from it 
Why why so divine, the pain of love 

Sometimes you crave for it, cry for it 
Women will die for it 
Looking back, cut the crap 
Was it really worth the rap? 
It's hard to survive the pain of love 

Ooh I need a time out 
Time to make my mind up 
Substitute a line out 
I'll be back next season with a bang 

No release from the jail 
No parole, no bail 
Hard labor, fifty lashes 
Hard labor, money splashes 
It's hard to survive the pain of love

Applying final touches 
Even though she's late for the dance 
I tell you tonight she's really gonna have a ball 
She's gonna really tie me up 
She's gonna really tie me up 
She's gonna really tie me up 
She's gonna really tie me up

Don't hurt me, don't hurt me

Tie me up, tie me up, tie me up, tie me up

I'm lost on that open road no peace do I find 
Maybe the wind'll blow a melody and ease my mind 

But soon love is broken, they'll take you away 
Oh the wars they been growing as no relief 
And the old men who ruled them oh they're just like thieves 
They rob from the sunshine, oh the air ain't so clean 
Our rivers are dirty where once we could see 

A smile from your lady friend looking down 
Look at that river hey did you ever shiver 
Well the earth is broken there is no one to save 

I remember quite freely only yesterday 
Ah the letter that I read from you read this way 
Take care lonesome Timmy, ah don't you start 
Thinking you're the only one year that's gone 
Out on your lonesome road hey lend a hand to your friend 
Yes he's just as lonely and the wind keeps you cold 

Remember the rivers that once did flow clean 

Ah sometimes I wonder how this old world keeps spinning 'round 
All the old folks have gone west, Lord preparing to die 
All except for a few of us hangers on 
Living each day with trivial hearts 

We just stop once in a while cry over the news 
In some foreign far city your brother's shot down 

Because there was a reason a gun had a hand 
And the old man killed youth, squeezed down its hope 
Now I'm just waiting brother waiting for the land 
Soon in my country there won't be a friend 
Each one is trying so hard to defend 
That one one last heartbeat before he's tugged away 

Lost in the mechanized efficient world logical skies 

Ah but no song was written on without a tear in your eyes 
Are we the last ones, the last ones to try"

One nation under God
Indivisible with liberty and justice for all

It feels so good to be back

I scrutinize every word, memorize every line
I spit it once, refuel, re-energize and rewind
I give sight to the blind, my insight through the mind
I exercise my right to express when I feel it's time

It's just all in your mind, what you interpret it as
I say to fight, you take it as I'mma whip someone's ass
If you don't understand, don't even bother to ask
A father who has grown up with a fatherless past

Who has blown up now to rap phenomenon that has
Or at least shows no difficulty multi-task
And in juggling both perhaps mastered his craft
Slash entrepreneur who has helped launch a few more rap acts

Who's had a few obstacles thrown his way through the last half
Of his career typical manure moving past that
Mr. kisses ass crack, he's a class act
Rubber band man, yea he just snaps back

Come along, follow me as I lead through the darkness
As I provide just enough spark that we need to proceed
Carry on, give me hope, give me strength
Come with me and I won't steer you wrong

Put your faith and your trust as I guide us through the fog
To the light at the end of the tunnel
We gonna fight, we gonna charge, we gonna stomp, we gonna march
Through the swamp, we gonna mosh through the marsh
Take us right through the doors, c'mon

All the people up top on the side and the middle
Come together lets all bomb and swamp just a little
Just let it gradually build from the front to the back
All you can see is a sea of people some white and some black

Don't matter what color, all that matters we gathered together
To celebrate for the same 'cause don't matter the weather
If it rains let it rain, yeah the wetter the better
They ain't gonna stop us they can't, we stronger now more than ever

They tell us no we say yea, they tell us stop we say go
Rebel with a rebel yell, raise hell we gonna let 'em know
Stomp, push, shove, mush, Fuck Bush
Until they bring our troops home, c'mon

Imagine it pouring, it's raining down on us
Mosh pits outside the oval office
Someone's tryina tell us something
Maybe this is God just sayin' we're responsible
For this monster, this coward that we have empowered

This is Bin Laden, look at his head noddin'
How could we allow something like this without pumping our fists
Now this is our final hour

Let me be the voice in your strength and your choice
Let me simplify the rhyme just to amplify the noise
Try to amplify the times it, and multiply by six-
Teen million people, Are equal at this high pitch

Maybe we can reach Al Queda through my speech
Let the president answer a higher anarchy
Strap him with an Ak-47, let him go, fight his own war
Let him impress daddy that way

No more blood for oil, we got our own battles to fight
On our own soil, no more psychological warfare
To trick us to thinking that we ain't loyal
If we don't serve our own country, we're patronizing a hero

Look in his eyes its all lies
The stars and stripes, they've been swiped, washed out and wiped
And replaced with his own face, mosh now or die
If I get sniped tonight you know why, 'cause I told you to fight

Through the swamp, we gonna mosh through the marsh
Take us right through the doors, c'mon

And as we proceed to Mosh
Through this desert storm
In these closing statements, if they should argue
Let us beg to differ

As we set aside our differences
And assemble our own army
To disarm this Weapon of Mass Destruction
That we call our President, for the present

And Mosh for the future of our next generation

All you see are zeros and ones
You took my hand and led me down to watch the kewpie doll parade
We let the kittens lick our hair and drank our chalky lemonade
It's not that I just didn't care I must admit I was afraid
And I'm awfully glad my finger's resting gently on the masterfade
The masterfade
I coulda played along
The masterfade
I coulda played Mah Jongg
But it just takes too long
And I just can't remember
Which way the east wind blows does it matter?
If we're all matter
What's it matter does it matter
If we're all matter when we're done?
When the sky is full of zeros and ones
I saw you standing all alone in the electrostatic rain
I thought at last I'd found a situation you can't explain
With GPS you know it's all just a matter of degrees
Your happiness won't find you underneath that canopy of trees
If the green grass is 6 the soybeans are 7
The junebugs are 8 the weeds and thistles are 11
And if the 1s just hold their place the 0s make a smiley face
When they come floating down from the heavens
You took my hand and led me down to watch a papillon parade
We let the kittens lick our hair and drank our chalky lemonade
You squeezed my hand and told me softly that I shouldn't be afraid
'Cause all the while your finger's resting gently on the masterfade
The masterfade
I coulda played along
The masterfade
I coulda played Mah Jongg
But it just takes too long
And who the hell can remember
Which way the east wind blows
When you're lying on the ground
Staring up at an inverted compass
I mean Christ who knows?"

But it never gets any more true
So close your eyes once more & once more believe
That they all still believe in you.

That a love, carved out of caring
Fashioned by fate, could suffer so hard
From the game played much too often

But making mistakes
Is a part of life's imperfections
Born of the years, it's not so wrong
To be human after all

Drawn into the stream of undefined illusion
Those diamond dreams, they can't disguise the truth

That there is something about you, baby
So right
I couldn't be without you, baby
Tonight

If ever our love was concealed
No-one could say
That you didn't feel a million things
In a perfect dream of life

Gone, fragile but free
We remain tender together
If not so in love; it's not so wrong
We're only human after all

These changing years, they add to your confusion
But you need to hear the time that told the truth

There is something about you, baby
So right
I couldn't be without you, baby
Tonight

It's what makes the world go round
It's what makes the rivers flow, and
It's what makes the sparrows sing, and
It's what makes the flowers grow, and
It's what gives the babies breath, and
It's what gives the sun its shine, and

God created changing seasons not in vain
The beauty of the weather's here for some distraction from our pain

Let a winter's snow fall entrance you

That the critics are all blasting me for
They'll never care for the brothers and sisters

Makin' a music, abuse it, but you can't do it, ya know
You call 'em demos, but we ride limos too

Whatcha gonna do?  Rap is not afraid of you
Beat is for Sonny Bono, beat is for Yoko Ono
Run-DMC first said a DJ couldn't be a band
Stand on its own feet, get you out your seat

You want to call our bluff
Get in line and wait your turn
And watch the witches burn

Don't flinch when innocents are dancing with the flames 
If they wanted to live, they'd learn to play the game
You can still walk away if you just hold your tongue
If you'd just walk away, you'd live to see the sun

But under this killing moon
Under this burning sky
The fire's shining groom
I hold my breath and close my eyes

The blood on our black gloves
It is none of your concern
You want to call our bluff
Get in line and wait your turn

And the home got snowed in
And a yellow moon glowed bright

When did you become so careless?

Tell me, what's going on in your head?
Was it something I said?
Are your feelings for me dead?

And oh, baby, please open your heart,

I've got something on my mind,
You are truly one of a kind.
So you see, I know I'll never find,
Someone to replace you.

Through the wallpaper's design
You live in all the constellations

In the bottom of a bottle
Reflected in a spoon

My English teacher wanted to have sex in junior high, the only problem was, my English teacher was a guy

Extra-terrestrial, killin' pedestrians, rapin' lesbians, while they screamin' ""Let's just be friends!"
723,ML724,Hanne Hukkelberg,Cast Anchor,relaxed,"Once I had this urge to go sailing
Leaving the shore in a boat of wood.
Sailing, sailing on, all alone

I will cast anchor a place where it's calm
And stay for a while
Sit back and wonder how things are down under and smile

Not the urge to go somewhere else
Not the urge to blow away
Not the urge to travel far
But the urge for standstill

I can imagine the fine weather
Sun rays playing between kind waves
A jumping fish says hello and the birds are singing"
724,ML725,Dolly Parton,Here You Come Again,happy,"Here you come again
Just when I've begun to get myself together
You waltz right in the door
Just like you've done before
And wrap my heart 'round your little finger

Here you come again
Just when I'm about to make it work without you
You look into my eyes
And lie those pretty lies
And pretty soon I'm wonderin' how I came to doubt you

All you got to do is smile that smile
And there go all my defenses
Just leave it up to you and in a little while
You're messin' up my mind and fillin' up my senses

Here you come again
Lookin' better than a body has a right to
And shakin' me up so
That all I really know
Is here you come again
And here I go

All you got to do is smile that smile
And there go all my defenses
Just leave it up to you and in a little while
You're messin' up my mind and fillin' up my senses

Lookin' better than a body has a right to

725,ML726,Pinback,Some Voices,relaxed,"Let the drive sequence begin. Hit it, Pinback...

She lays among the flowers
And spreads among the sheets.
She counts the clouds for hours
And turns them into sheep.
They sleep along the rivers
And shower in the deep
And breath in all that's Autumn,
Till Winter stays.

They almost didn't find her,
A couple times she walked to the train tracks

Sometimes her forehead gets hot.
It comes and goes.
Sometimes the medicine can heal her kind.
It's like a hurricane inside her.
Inside the hurricane her mind gets blown.

It's like a hurricane inside her."

(Girl) Oah, oahhhah
(2Pac) I got nuttin to lose
It's just me against the world
(Girl) Oh-hah
(2Pac) Stuck in the game
Me against the world baby

Verse One: 2Pac

Can you picture my prophecy?
Stress in the city, the cops is hot for me
The projects is full of bullets, the bodies is droppin'
There ain't no stoppin' me
Constantly movin while makin' millions
Witnessin killings, leavin' dead bodies in abandoned buildings
Carries to children 'cause they're illin
Addicted to killin' and the appeal from the cap peelin
Without feelin', but will they last or be blasted?
Hard headed bastard
Maybe he'll listen in his casket -- the aftermath
More bodies being buried -- I'm losing my homies in a hurry
They're relocating to the cemetery
Got me worried, stressin, my vision's blurried
The question is will I live? No one in the world loves me
I'm headed for danger, don't trust strangers
Put one in the chamber whenever I'm feelin' this anger
Don't wanna make excuses, cause this is how it is
What's the use unless we're shootin no one notices the youth
It's just me against the world baby

(Girl) Me against the world
(2Pac) It's just me against the world
(Girl) Ooh yeah, ooh-hoo
(2Pac) It's just me against the world

(Girl) Hey!
(2Pac) Me against the world
(Girl) Ooh yeah
(2Pac) I got nuttin to lose
It's just me against the world baby
(Girl) I got nothing to lose

Verse Two: Dramacydal

Could somebody help me? I'm out here all by myself
See ladies in stones, Baby Capone's, livin' wealthy
Pictures of my birth on this Earth is what I'm dreamin'
Seein Daddy's semen, full of crooked demons, already crazy
And screamin I guess them nightmares as a child
Had me scared, but left me prepared for a while
Is there another route? For a crooked Outlaw
Veteran, a villain, a young thug, who one day shall fall

Everday there's mo'death, and plus I'm dough-less
I'm seein mo' reasons for me to proceed with thievin
Scheme on the scheming and leave they peeps grieving
Cause ain't no bucks to stack up, my nuts is backed up
I'm bout to act up, go load the Mac up, now watch me klacka
Tried makin' fat cuts, but yo it ain't workin
And Evil's lurking, I can see him smirking
When I gets to pervin, so what?
Go put some work in, and make my mail, makin' sales
Risking 25 with a 'L', but oh well

(Girl) Me against the world, hoah
(2Pac) Me against the world
I got nuttin to lose
It's just me against the world baby
(Girl) Ha-hah (hehe) hey!

Verse Three: 2Pac

With all this extra stressin
The question I wonder is after death, after my last breath
When will I finally get to rest? Through this supression
They punish the people that's askin questions
And those that possess, steal from the ones without possesions
The message I stress: to make it stop study your lessons
Don't settle for less - even the genius asks-es questions
Be grateful for blessings
Don't ever change, keep your essence
The power is in the people and politics we address
Always do your best, don't let the pressure make you panic
And when you get stranded
And things don't go the way you planned it
Dreamin' of riches, in a position of makin' a difference
Politicians and hypocrites, they don't wanna listen
If I'm insane, it's the fame made a brother change
It wasn't nuttin like the game
It's just me against the world

(Girl) Me against the world
(2Pac) Nuttin to lose
It's just me against the world baby
(Girl) Me against the world
(2Pac) Got me stuck in the game
It's just me against the world
(Girl) Oahah
(2Pac) I'd be ashamed to lose
It's just me against the world baby
(Girl) Me against the world

Outro: 2Pac

Heh, hahahahahahah
That's right
I know it seem hard sometimes but uh
Remember one thing
Through every dark night, there's a bright day after that
So no matter how hard it get, stick your chest out
Keep your head up, and handle it

Me against the world

Bragging that you know how the niggers feel cold
And the slum's got so much soul

You want everyone to act like you
Kiss ass while you bitch, so you can get rich
But your boss gets richer off you

Well, you'll work harder with a gun in your back
For a bowl of rice a day
Slave for soldiers till you starve
Then your head is skewered on a stake

Now you can go where people are one
Now you can go where they get things done
What you need, my son
What you need, my son

Where you'll kiss ass or crack

But I'm trying madly to calm these nerves
With something new

I got this heavy debt, I've got nothing left
But this daunting weight slung round my neck
You got the callous mouth, all your endless doubts
We spent this fifteen weeks, trying to work it out
Do think we're getting to something new?

Oh God, not another fight
I'm always trying to get the details right
I remember when you told me you felt saved
When you promised you'd lay flowers on my grave
Just like they used to do
Is it something new?

And now here I stand
With these blood soaked hands
On this sleepless night, that never ends
And these songs I sing
With these hopes that I cling to
Desperately wondering
Are we finally getting to something new?

Watch a thousand housewives fizz and burn
And every time she answers yes

Got a touch of Einstein to her brain
She wears fat clothes but she's cunning
People say she's easy all the same

The pass is picking up all the lyrics on the dance floor

Tricky's performing, taking his phono
Making a stand with a tan, touch it like cocoa
Smooth to keep you moving at the back now
Free is the needle, it's moving through the track now

Dance to the drummer's beats, we need new sticks
Bounce around the vibes like acoustics
No drugs or pharmaceuticals
For the body ain't suitable
Stick with liquid me and trick we've drop
A paper which you use my tongue to lick with

Trouble and strife ain't no sunshine in my life
Wiseguys get protection when they carry a knife
They shouldn't have been born, they're making me yawn

So you come on light my fire and together we'll grow
Forever watch my Akai rig go

Because my Akai rig goes boom boom
My Akai rig goes boom boom

Don't make sound

Yes

'Cause the dancefloor's a desert and the dancers are parched
Do a rain dance and your brain's still marsh
My heavy, my brother get lighter than helium
Float above the world to break the tedium
Living in my headphones Sony's what I say to 'em
The surreal boom of the Budokan stadium

Well, I'm floating on air
When I'm daydreaming
I quietly observe standing in my space

Well, I'm tricky kid, don't deal with sadness
Can't be with the one I love, I love the one that I miss
I'm very down to earth, but brain sits on top floor
Don't need another lover, just need, I'm insecure

The weather is changing the storms be shaking
The love that you take is equal to the love you're makin'
Here comes the sun, little darling, here comes the sun

It's all right

Yes, tricky kid, I check my situation
Maggie this, Maggie that, Maggie means inflation
Hip-hop you don't stop 'cause I'm not sloppy
I like the beat, so we need another copy

We're natives of the massive territory and we're proud
Get peaceful in the dance, adapt the glory and the crowd
The problem ain't a different kind of skin tricks
I love my neighbour, I don't wait for the olympics
See you go hooligan, you're trying to play the fool again

Caught you in the lost and found

When your posse weren't around

Days since I last pissed; cheeks sunken and despaired. 
So gorgeous, sunk to six stone; lose my only remaining home 
See my third rib appear, a week later all my flesh disappears. 
Stretching taut, cling-film on bone; I'm getting better 

Karen says I've reached my target weight, 
Kate and Emma and Kristin know it's fake
Problem is ""diet""'s not a big enough word

I wanna be so skinny that I rot from view

I want to walk in the snow and not leave a footprint
I want to walk in the snow and not soil its purity

Stomach collapsed at five; lift up my skirt my sex is gone. 
Naked and lovely and 5 st. 2; may I bud and never flower
My vision's getting blurred but I can see my ribs and I feel fine. 
My hands are trembling stalks and I can feel my breasts are shrinking

Mother tries to choke me with roast beef, and sits savouring her sole Ryvita
""That's the way you're built"", my father said

But I can change; my cocoon shedding

I want to walk in the snow and not leave a footprint
I want to walk in the snow and not soil its purity

Kate and Kristin and Kit-Kat; all things I like looking at
Too weak to fuss, too weak to die. Choice is skeletal in everybody's life
I choose, my choice, I starve to frenzy. Hunger soon passes and sickness soon tires
Legs bent, stockinged, I am Twiggy. And I don't mind the horror that surrounds me
Self-worth scatters, self-esteem's a bore; I long since moved to a higher plateau
This discipline's so rare, so please applaud. Just look at the fat scum who pamper me so
Yeah 4 st. 7, an epilogue of youth. Such beautiful dignity in self-abuse
I've finally come to understand life through staring blankly at my navel"

On and on and on

This is the year that I come in and just devastate
My style is great ask your peoples can I dominate?
My rhymes are harder than last night's erection
Don't play me close, I'll have this mic up in your mid-section
My shit is lovely simply meaning that my joint is tight
Amping up the mic making sure production's tight
Sometimes I might catch a severe case of writer's block
But by the end of the day you'll be on my jock
My name's Malik my hobby's putting MC's to the test
And if you front I'll put my foot up in your freaking chest
Freestyle fanatic, and never will it ever stop
You crew is loose, you might just want to call the cops

Aye, yo I gotta put some action on paper
Make sure my verse jump up and spread out like the raper
The only tip I got for a waiter
Is watch the doorknob hit me where the dirty dog shoulda' bit me
That was my train of thought, but for so long I fought
Now I'm at a level supreme to the devil
So turn up the bass and lay low on the treble
We be the real MC's and you dead, bring a shovel
Revitalize, the vital Tribe nigga, WHAT?
The ladies sweat the style like the squirrel sweat the nuts
You know a fellas good for the moola
Don't smoke no woolas, read the name call me Slick Tip the Ruler

Sometimes Shaitan got me by the pressure points
But I can break a fella down like sex
You eat Wheat Chex but still light in the ass and can't flex
If one nigga front I'mma make more pay
'Cause tonight, we gettin' off like O.J
And yo I got a Dawg that bites, fuck the barking
Yo I got a crew with the beats and the smarts and

I fought my shit up on Linden in the one-nine-two
Forever writing never biting ain't shit else to do
Hoping to battle, but most MC's ain't ready yet
But if they utter one word then it's as good as set
You have MC's dropping bombs that's incredible
Some of the brothers, their styles are just despicable
As for me see I just do how I love to do
Try to deny me of my props then I'll be seeing you
Most of you suckers wanna be down for the tag along
The freaking fame, someone tell 'em that this shit ain't games
You gots to do this from your heart meaning your inner soul
And if it's real only then will you be on a roll
I try to stay on top my game there ain't no time to lose
Four albums deep as a Quester but still we payin' dues
So hear me out one time, you gots to be yourself
'Cause if you ain't yourself you end up by your freaking self
I'm coming rugged with the Linden Boule type of slang
And yo, we'll see who can hang yo

There goes the Robert E. Lee
Now I don't mind chopping wood
And I don't care if the money's no good
Just take what you need and leave the rest
But they should never have taken the very best

And like my brother before me, I took a rebel stand
Oh, he was just 18, proud and brave
But a yankee laid him in his grave

um sonho que sonhou
não conta tudo o que encontrou

Eu sonhei
um sonho com amor
e uma janela e uma flor
uma fonte de água e o meu amigo
E não havia mais nada...
só nós, a luz, e mais nada...
Ali morou o amor

Amor,
Amor que trago em segredo
num sonho que não vou contar
e cada dia é mais sentido

Amor,
eu tenho amor bem escondido
num sonho que não sei contar

As a youth, was it just to exist autonomously?
No, we don't wanna work
We just wanna fuck, swallow pills, and forget our curses

No, we don't need pigs like you
We follow the laws of our emptying veins
In this world of nothing for me
I'd be sooner destroyed

Raise your cups to the ne'er-waning moon
Let its visage ring true!
To the hearts cold and blue
We're dying each moment free

We're all animals here
Flesh and blood, bone and dream
We're just impulses here
Just another piece of shit in the storm

Just another piece of shit!

SHIT! [Echoes]

From the smelling of things it appears
This shit has come to a boil
Nighttime we shall rule as our own
While this hollow will sleep
We shall bark at the moon

In this world of nothing for me
I'd be sooner destroyed
In this world there is nothing for us
But the sound, but the sound!

Vampire youth
Raise your cups to the ne'er-waning moon
Let its visage ring true!

We'll be going fucking mad

Strewn on the fields of Belgium and France
Poppies for young men, death's bitter trade
All of those young lives betrayed

The children of England would never be slaves
They're trapped on the wire and dying in waves
The flower of England face down in the mud
And stained in the blood of a whole generation

Corpulent generals safe behind lines
History's lessons drowned in red wine
Poppies for young men, death's bitter trade

Once or twice

And you say, we'll be fine just like the last time,
Fine just like the last time, baby

What you mean to me
You're my constant

You gotta promise me
That you'll always be around"
778,ML779,Ella Fitzgerald,Solitude ,relaxed,"In my solitude you haunt me
With reveries of days gone by
In my solitude you taunt me
With memories that never die

I sit in my chair
Filled with despair
Nobody could be so sad
With gloom ev'rywhere

I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad
In my solitude
I'm praying

Dear Lord above
Send back my love
I sit in my chair
I'm filled with despair

There's no one could be so sad
With gloom ev'rywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad

In my solitude
I'm praying
Dear Lord above
Send back my love"
779,ML780,Ben Kweller,Thirteen,sad,"We've been in the rain
We've been on the mountain
We've been 'round the fire

In fancy hotels
Drank water from farm wells
We sang with the choir

I kissed your dry lips
We jumped off the high cliffs
And splashed down below

Skin to skin
In the salty river
Made love in the shadows
Whoa ooh

Read books to each other
Read the mind of the other
Flew 1,000 jets

We laughed and we cried
At movies and real life
And our ridiculous bets

We danced in the moonlight at midnight
We pressed against back doors and wood floors
And you never faked it

Infrequently
We ignored our love
But we could never mistake it
Ooh ooh

We met on the front porch
Fell in love on the phone
Without the physical wreck

You gave me the necklace
That used to hang
Around your mother's neck

We questioned religions
Gave bread to the pigeons
We learned how to pray

We stood by the ocean
Turned our hearts into one
We laid in bed all day
Heeey

We skipped on the sidewalk
Skipped stones on the water
Skipped town

We've seen the sunrise with new eyes
We've seen the damage of gossip and true lies
We've seen the sun go down

Had passionate make outs
And passionate freak outs
We built this world of our own

It was in the back of a taxi
When you told me you loved me
And that I wasn't alone"
780,ML781,Ozzy Osbourne,Running Out of Time,angry,"Been around this world so many times
If you could only see my mind
I watch my secret heaven turn to hell

Faith alone has guided me
The ghost of my own destiny
I haven't even got a soul to sell

All the things I put me through
I wouldn't wish my hell on you
You'll never know whats going on inside

Just another lonely broken hero
Picking up the pieces of my mind
Running out of faith and hope and reason

I'm running out of time
Running out of time

Trouble always seems to find
A way to live inside my mind
My haunted hell and me remain alone

Underneath my masquerade
A simple man who's so afraid
I tried to find a light to guide me home

Mama please, just hold me tight
Feeling so afraid tonight
'Cause you're the only one that really knows

Just another lonely broken hero
Picking up the pieces of my mind
Running out of faith and hope and reason

I'm running out of time
Running out of time

Fighting for my sanity
Many nights of tragedy
Got to leave my wretched ways behind

Just another lonely broken hero
Picking up the pieces of my mind
Running out of faith and hope and reason

I'm running out of time
Running out of time
I'm running out of time
Running out of time"

There are times and days, they mean nothing to me

I'm not getting out the boxes, spread all over the floor
I've been looking through some of them old pictures
Those faces they mean nothing to me no more

I travel light
You travel light
Everything I've done
You say you can justify, you travel light
I can't pick them out, I can't put them in these sad old bags
Some things you have to lose along the way
Times are hard, I'll only pick them out, wish I was going back
Times are good, you'll be glad you ran away

Do you remember, how much you loved me?
You say you have no room in that thick old head
Well it comes with the hurt and the guilt, and the memories
If I had to take them with me I would never get from my bed
There's a crack in the roof where the rain pours through
That's the place you always decide to sit
Yeah I know I'm there for hours, the water running down (my) (your) face
Do you really think you keep it all that well hid?

No but I travel light

By the seven wonders
By myriad mortals

Outside!
Outside desert of restriction
In act of rebellion
On the sea of motion
Stability of matter
By serenity, strength and beauty
By the mighty chant of every breath

In serpentine dance of blood cells
In simplicity of spells
Divine names, meta-games
I greet thy presence

Oh Snake! Thou art God!
Coiled underneath my throne
With thee, I reunite
With blood, we make this covenant
Myself, I redefine
Look in and above

There is more than the flesh
Look careful and thou may see
The unextinguished flame
The nectar of thy rage

I taste from the cup of fornication
And woman by my side
And scarlet is her skin
She's eager to rise
And so eager to please

Another day
Another eternity gone
And on the stairway to salvation
I walk alone among the falling stars
Looking for company
Where art thou?
Oh, lacerate ones!

Arise! My sweetest friend
Or be forever fallen
We have finally arrived
From prison of this life
To Kali's womb
Down to the earth
As angels of almighty god
Chaos!
'Tis our last fall
To touch our mother whore
The harlot of the saints
That spits on the rotten cross
Incinerate the icon
The symbol of all loss
To stand straight
At the left hand of God

Join me among the bright hosts
Wondering neither way of light
Nor darkness
Of which seed
Sprouts dispassionately
In the summer of my life"

I'll make it better than you ever dreamed
And the rest of your life will be just like this

(Baby) So listen up, it's you I trust
I feel magic every time that we touch baby, baby
I pledge allegiance to the heavens above
Tonight to you baby I make my declaration of love

So listen up, it's you I trust
I feel magic every time that we touch
I pledge allegiance to the heavens above

I refuse to lose
Here's your ticket
Hear the drummer get wicked
The crew to you to push the back to Black
Attack so I sat and japped
Then slapped the Mac (Intosh)
Now I'm ready to mike it
(You know I like it) huh
Hear my favoritism roll ""Oh""
Never be a brother like to go solo
Lazer, anastasia, maze ya
Ways to blaze your brain and train ya
The way I'm livin', forgiven'
What I'm givin' up
X on the flex hit me now
I don't know about later
As for now I know how to avoid the paranoid
Man I've had it up to here
Gear I wear got 'em goin' in fear
Rhetoric said
Read just a bit ago
Not quittin' though
Signed the hard rhymer
Work to keep from gettin' jerked
Changin' some ways
To way back in the better days
Raw metaphysically bold
Never followed a code
Still dropped a load
Never question what I am God knows
'Cause it's comin' from the heart
What I got better get some
(Get on up) hustler of culture
Snakebitten
Been spit in the face
But the rhymes keep fittin'
Respects been givin' how's ya livin'
Now I can't protect a pad off defect
Check the record
An reckon an intentional wreck
Played off as some intellect
Made the call, took the fall
Broke the laws
Not my fault they're fallin' off
Known as fair square
Throughout my years
So I growl at the livin' foul
Black to the bone my home is your home
So welcome to the Terrordome
Subordinate terror
Kickin' off an era
Cold deliverin' pain
My 98 was 87 on a record yo
So now I go Bronco

Crucifixion ain't no fiction
So called chosen frozen
Apology made to who ever pleases
Still they got me like Jesus
I rather sing, bring, think reminisce
'Bout a brother while I'm in sync
Every brother ain't a brother cause a color
Just as well could be undercover
Backstabbed, grabbed a flag
From the back of the lab
Told a Rab get off the rag
Sad to say I got sold down the river
Still some quiver when I deliver
Never to say I never know or had a clue
Word was heard, plus hard on the boulevard
Lies, scandalizin', basin'
Traits of hate who's celebratin' wit Satan?
I rope a dope the evil with righteous
Bobbin' and weavin' and let the good get even
C'mon down
And welcome to the Terrordome.
Caught in the race against time
The pit and the pendulum
Check the rhythm and rhymes
While I'm bendin' 'em
Snakes blowin' up the lines of design
Tryin' to blind the science I'm snedin' 'em
How to fight the power
Cannot run and hide
But it shouldn't be suicide
In a game a fool without the rules
Got a hell of a nerve to just criticize
Every brother ain't a brother
Cause a Black hand
Squeezed on Malcolm X the man
The shootin' of Huey Newton
From a hand of a Nigger who pulled the trigger

It's weak to speak and blame somebody else
When you destroy yourself
First nothing's worse than a mother's pain
Of a son slain in Bensonhurst
Can't wait for the state to decide the fate
So this jam I dedicate
Places with racist faces
Just an example of one of many cases
The Greek weekend speech I speak
From a lesson learned in Virginia (Beach)
I don't smile in the line of fire
I go wildin'
But it's on bass and drums even violins
Watcha do gitcha head ready
Instead of gettin' physically sweaty
When I get mad
I put it down on a pad
Give ya somethin' that cha never had controllin'
Fear of high rollin'
God bless your soul and keep livin'
Never allowed, kickin' it loud
Droppin' a bomb
Brain game intellectual Vietnam
Move as a team
Never move alone
But

Gang-banged by your manager, fella,
Gettin' money out your ass, like a muthaphukkin' Ready Teller
Givin' up the dollar bills,
Now they got the Villain with a purse and high-heels
So don't believe what Ren say,
'Cause he's goin' out like Kunta Kinte,
But I got a whip for ya Toby;
Used to be my homie,
Now you act like you don't know me
It's a case of divide-and-conquer,
'Cause you let a Jew break up my crew
House nigga, gotta run and hide!
Yellin' Compton, but you moved to Riverside
So don't front, MC Ren,
'Cause I remember when you drove a B210
Broke as a motherfuckin' joke, they let you on the scene

Throw a house nigga in a ditch
Half-pint bitch, fuckin' your homeboys, you little maggot
Eazy-E turned faggot
With your manager, fella ---
Fuckin' MC Ren, Dr. Dre, and Yella
But if they were smart as me,
Eazy-E would be hangin' from a tree
With no Vaseline ---
Just a match, and a little bit of gasoline
Light 'em up, burn 'em up, flame on...
Till that Jheri curl is gone
On a permanent vacation,
Off the Massa plantation
Heard you both got the same bank account
Dumb nigga! What you thinkin' bout?!
Get rid of that Devil real simple:
Put a bullet in his temple
'Cause you can't be the ""Niggaz4Life"" crew
With a white Jew tellin' you what to do
Pullin' wools with your scams;
Now I gotta play the ""Silence of the Lambs""
With a midget who's a punk too
Tryin' to fuck me, but ""I'd rather fuck you""

And the world your balloon
Peeping tom for the mother station.
Winter's cold, spring races
And the calm away by the storm is chasing
Everything good needs replacing
Look up, look down all around, hey satellite

Satellite, headlines read
Someone's secrets you've seen
Eyes and ears have been
Satellite dish in my yard
Tell me more, tell me more
Who's the king of your satellite castle?

Winter's cold spring erases
And the calm away by the storm is chasing
Everything good needs replacing
Look up, look down all around, hey satellite
Rest high above the clouds no resrictions
Television we bounce 'round the world
And while I spend these hours
Five senses reeling,
I laugh about this weatherman's satellite eyes.

Satellite in my eyes
Like a diamond in the sky
How I wonder.
Satellite strung from the moon
And the world your balloon
Peeping tom for the mother station

Winter's cold spring erases

Everything good needs replacing
Look up, look down all around, hey satellite

Television you bounce from the world
And while I spend these hours
Five senses reeling

821,ML822,Celtic Woman,Over The Rainbow,relaxed,"Somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high
There's a land that I heard of
Once in a lullaby

Somewhere over the rainbow
Skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream
Really do come true

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where troubles melt like lemondrops
Away above the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me

Somewhere over the rainbow
Bluebirds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why, then, oh why can't I?

Somewhere over the rainbow
Skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream
Really do come true"
822,ML823,Marty Robbins,El Paso,relaxed,"Out in the West Texas town of El Paso
I fell in love with a Mexican girl
Nighttime would find me in Rosa's cantina
Music would play and Felina would whirl

Blacker than night were the eyes of Felina
Wicked and evil while casting a spell
My love was deep for this Mexican maiden
I was in love, but in vain, I could tell

One night a wild young cowboy came in
Wild as the West Texas wind
Dashing and daring, a drink he was sharing
With wicked Felina, the girl that I loved

So in anger I
Challenged his right for the love of this maiden
Down went his hand for the gun that he wore
My challenge was answered in less than a heartbeat
The handsome young stranger lay dead on the floor

Just for a moment I stood there in silence
Shocked by the foul evil deed I had done
Many thoughts raced through my mind as I stood there
I had but one chance and that was to run

Out through the back door of Rosa's I ran
Out where the horses were tied
I caught a good one, it looked like it could run
Up on its back and away I did ride

Just as fast as I
Could from the West Texas town of El Paso
Out to the badlands of New Mexico

Back in El Paso my life would be worthless
Everything's gone in life; nothing is left
It's been so long since I've seen the young maiden
My love is stronger than my fear of death

I saddled up and away I did go
Riding alone in the dark
Maybe tomorrow a bullet may find me
Tonight nothing's worse than this pain in my heart

And at last here I
Am on the hill overlooking El Paso
I can see Rosa's cantina below
My love is strong and it pushes me onward
Down off the hill to Felina I go

Off to my right I see five mounted cowboys
Off to my left ride a dozen or more
Shouting and shooting, I can't let them catch me
I have to make it to Rosa's back door

Something is dreadfully wrong for I feel
A deep burning pain in my side
Though I am trying to stay in the saddle
I'm getting weary, unable to ride

But my love for
Felina is strong and I rise where I've fallen
Though I am weary I can't stop to rest
I see the white puff of smoke from the rifle
I feel the bullet go deep in my chest

From out of nowhere Felina has found me
Kissing my cheek as she kneels by my side
Cradled by two loving arms that I'll die for
One little kiss and Felina, goodbye"

Say I'll be okay

And if I fall through these days that go by without cause
Just a painful mistake has left me here on my own
And if I fall through these nights I can't seem to go on
Just a sign that you're with me gives me the strength to hold on

Now that the lines been broken
I'm too afraid to just look back
The pages have left an empty space 
You were all I had
Why does it have to be this way
These things they'll never change
Still I'm left with knowing, content and happy, this is all I need

Or the black-root and the vine

The past and the horizon line

Every time you close your eyes?
And behind every bolted door
Is there a voice you recognise?
Singing prayers, singing curses
Singing all about the dream

Uh, you can tell from the scars on my arms

That I'm not the carefullest of girls

You can tell from the glass on the floor
And the strings that're breaking
And I keep on breaking more
And it looks like I am shaking
But it's just the temperature

Then again if it were any colder I could disengage
If I were any older I would act my age
But I don't think that you'd believe me
It's not the way I'm meant to be
It's just the way the operation made me

And you can tell from the state of my room
That they let me out too soon
And the pills that I ate
Came a couple years too late
And I've got some issues to work through
There I go again
Pretending to be you
Make-believing
That I have a soul beneath the surface
Trying to convince you
It was accidentally on purpose

I am not so serious
This passion is a plagiarism
I might join your century
But only on a rare occasion
I was taken out
Before the labor pains set in and now
Behold the world's worst accident

And the bruises on my thighs
And the knots in my hair
And the bathtub full of flies
That I'm not right now at all

Pretending that I'll fall
Don't call the doctors
They've seen it all before
They'll say just
Let her crash and burn, she'll learn
The attention just encourages her

And you can tell from the full-body cast
That you're sorry that you asked
Though you did everything you could
Like any decent person would
But I might be catching, so don't touch
You'll start believing
You're immune to gravity and stuff
Don't get me wet
Because the bandages will all come off

And you can tell
From the smoke at the stake
That the current state is critical
Well, it is the little things, for instance
In the time it takes to break it she can make up ten excuses
Please excuse her for the day
It's just the way the medication makes her

I don't necessarily believe there is a cure for this
So I might join your century
But only as a doubtful guest
I was too precarious, removed as a caesarian
Behold the world's worst accident

When the first snow is on the ground

How a love so young can be cut down

867,ML868,Bruce Springsteen,War,angry,"If you grew up in the 60's
You grew up with war on TV every night
A war that your friends were involved in

And I want to do this song tonight for all the young people out there
If you're in your teens
Because I remember a lot of my friends when they we were 17 or 18
We didn't have much of a chance to think about how we felt about a lot of things

And the next time they're gonna be looking at you
And you're gonna need a lot of information to know what you're gonna wanna do
Because in 1985, blind faith in your leaders, or in anything, will get you killed
'Cause what I'm talking about here is

War (Ooh!), ooh, yeaheaheaheah
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing!
Say it again

War (Ooh!), ooh, yeaheaheaheah
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing!
Come on!

War is something that I despise
For it means destruction of innocent lives
And thousands of mothers and their mothers cry
When their sons go out to fight to give their lives

War (Ooh!), ohoho, yeah
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing!
Say it again

War (Ooh!), ohoho, yeah
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing!
Hey!

War (Ooh!), it's nothing but a heartbreaker
War (Ooh!), friend only to the undertaker

Yeah, the war is the enemy of all mankind
The thought of War (Ooh!), it blows my mind
Handed down from generation to generation
Induction, destruction, who wants to die?

War (Ooh!), ohoho now
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing!
Say it again

War (Ooh!), yeaheaheaheah
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing!
Come on, man

War (Ooh!), it ain't nothing but a heartbreaker
War (Ooh!), friend only to the undertaker

War has shattered many young men's dreams
Made them disabled, bitter and mean
Life is too precious to be fighting wars each day
War can't give life, it can only take it away

War (Ooh!), ohoho, yeah
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing!
Say it again

War (Ooh!), good god
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing!

Peace love and understanding, god
There must be some place for these things today
They say we must fight to keep our freedom
But, Lord, there's gotta be another way that's better than

True philosophies from the lips of black Socrates

Killing Dracula MC's who bit from my vernacular

No lullaby, got you high, when I rock a fly

Give a heave-ho, and stimulate your cerebral system

Makin' lovely word connections like Chuck Woolery

Electrifyin' like some nocturnal sunshine

And how many tatoos you got on your arm.
So how did we get here where'd it all go wrong?
Flying through the airwaves coming into your home
All the suits in Hollywood are gonna roll in all the dough

Tell me that you need it tell me that you feel it this is the new sensation
Come on and just try it you know you can't fight it this is gonna sweep the
Nation.

I think back to this day when all the bands used to play
Without giving a shit about what was in
Now it has changed scenes rearranged
Let's start it over again
What really matters to me is so easy to see
It's staring us right in the face
We gotta put it behind get back in line
We gotta save this dying race.

And I can't conceal that I'm slowly weakening

Spin around inside my head unendingly
Throughts run wild as I sit and rhapsodize
Paint pretty pictures of what I'd do if you were mine

881,ML882,Cradle of Filth,Lovesick for Mina,angry,"One might see in Mina
My disease
But it was She who has infected me
For all eternity...

As the sun slips the tearaway stars
Into the scented scheme of night
I kissed her mouth like a dark red rose
Set upon a marbled dream of white
So pure of thought like a Vestal statue
Jewelled with a God-lent grace
I was close to coming when she bid adieu
Fuelled by heartache rent upon her face there

Oh Mina, obscener
Thoughts obsess my days
Oh Mina, obscener
Thoughts possess me
That I must now obey

They say the darkest hour
Is that before the dawn
When nothing in one's power
Can dissipate the great forlorn
Shadows of fire that haunt me
Like risen whispers of her name

For dawn is a dusk
Wherein needs must
Erupt from the grave, aflame

Written in the dead of night
And riding on the burning wind
Smitten by her read delight
My words alight like leave of sin

Stepping through a mirror
The princess of the emerald glass
Brought me on sip nearer
Love's infernal past...

They say Hell hath no furies
Like a woman scorned by life
When the Heavenly Judge and juries
Participate to chain this wife
With forced virtue, Her secret needs
On warm we nights, with storm-wracked bites
I gave her Eden after the flood

Written in the dead of night
And riding on the burning wind
Smitten by her read delight
My words alight like leaves of sin

Verona, Marishka, Aleera
Brides of old and goddesses all
Forgive my wishes to be always near her
Forever or whenever seas recall

The Aphrodite from my embrace
For as Mars (whom her lips placate)
I tore these shores with wars of hatred
Before our Paris wet his fate
In Helen, one might find mistake
In winning tragedy
For all eternity...

I am still lovesick for Mina
I am still so lovesick for Mina"

Good dancing love, but you should have worn a bra
Guy on the mic and he's making too much noise
There's these girls in the corner want attention from the boys

I see these girls and they're shouting through the crowd
Don't understand why they're being really loud
Make their way over to me and try and push me out the way
I push her back, she looks at me and says, ""What you tryn'a say?""

The tender love and care
And when you need to change the light bulb
You won't hand me the chair

And when we're tired of the city
And we find a country home
You'll sell your vinyl records
And go get us a loan

You'll be my sympathetic lover and won't steal the covers

You won't forsake me, your mother won't hate me

Kick ya and flick ya, now they want to label this nigga tape with a sticker

And I'm lookin' out the window like Malcolm
Ready to bring that noise and kinda trigger happy like the Geto Boys

'Cause police got equal, pay, A horse is a pig that don't fly straight

Just a super slave
We'll have to break his ass up like Super Dave...

I'm wicked enough to pull this

Sometimes I feel like I'm not that strong
Sometimes I feel so frail so small
Sometimes I feel vulnerable
Sometimes I feel a little fragile

In six thousand years what will this mean
Words from the heart or a melody
So caught in emotion and I'm overcome
As I'm falling down I come undone

Sometimes I feel like I'm alone
Sometimes I feel like I'm not that strong
Sometimes I feel nothing at all
Sometimes I feel vulnerable
Sometimes I feel a little fragile

If people can see right through my eyes
like an open door that I can't disguise
I won't be afraid from the tears I cry
I'll not run I'll not hide this is how I feel inside

To Burn your places of Worship
Our Gods shall become your Gods

All that lives on the vine is rotten
May your wines be foul
And your bread as the flesh of the dead
An ill wind to bring nought but decay
And the stench of your Slaughtered kin

The newborn, borne with fear in their eyes
And slavery in their limbs
As tools to build a new Empire
We are your cross to bear
Perhaps you shall be a martyred people
But as sure as the Night follows the Day

To stop turning, turning
Till you return again
If you ever do
For what good is love
Without loving you?
Can I tell you now
As you turn to go
I'll be dying slowly
Till the next hello

But if you stay
I'll make you a night
Like no night has been
Or will be again
I'll sail on your smile
I'll glide on your touch
I'll talk to your eyes
That I love so much

But if you go
I won't cry
Though the good is gone
From the word goodbye

If you go away
As I know you must
There'll be nothing left

Just an empty room
Full of empty space

'Round the heights of concrete hills
You can see the pinnacles

In the streets are many walls
Hear the peasants come and crawl
You can hear their lovers call

In their shiny metal cars
Through the woods of steel and glass

I'm lying in the hospital
Pinned against a bed
A stethoscope upon my heart
A hand against my head

They're peeling off the bandages
I'm wincing in the light
The nurse is looking anxious
And she's quivering with fright

I'm looking through Gary Gilmore's eyes
Looking through Gary Gilmore's eyes
Looking through Gary Gilmore's eyes
Looking through Gary Gilmore's eyes

The doctors are avoiding me
My vision is confused
I listen to my earphones
And I catch the evening news

A murderer's been killed
And he donates his sight to science
I'm locked into a private ward
I realise that I must be

Looking through Gary Gilmore's eyes
Looking through Gary Gilmore's eyes

Looking through Gary Gilmore's eyes
Looking through Gary Gilmore's eyes
Looking through Gary Gilmore's eyes

I smash the light in anger
Push my bed against the door
I close my lids across the eyes
And wish to see no more

The eye receives the messages
And sends 'em to the brain
No guarantee the stimuli must be perceived the same
When looking through Gary Gilmore's eyes

Looking through Gary Gilmore's eyes
Looking through Gary Gilmore's eyes
Looking through Gary Gilmore's eyes
Looking through Gary Gilmore's eyes

Gary and his eyes have parted company"

But summer could take a few lessons from her
Picture a tomboy in lace
That's Nancy with the laughing face

Did you ever hear mission bells ringing?
Well, she'll give you the very same glow
When she speaks you would think it was singing
Just hear her say hello

I swear to goodness, you can't resist her
Sorry for you she has no sister
No angel could replace

She makes my heart a charcoal burner
It's heaven when I embrace

If one day I'd find
Someone who would take my hand
And samba through life with me

Someone to cling to me
Stay with me right or wrong 
Someone to sing to me 
Some little samba song 
Someone to take my heart

Give love a start with me

913,ML914,Bright Eyes,Classic Cars,relaxed,"She was a real royal lady, true patron of the arts
She said the best country singers die in the back of classic cars
So if I ever got too hungry for a suitcase or guitar
To think of them all alone in the dark

So I laid some nights beside her in a bed made for a queen
She said I kissed her different, that all the men her age were mean
Gave me anything I wanted, Oh the generosity
I took all that I could, it was free

Now the sky is a torn up denim and the clouds are just splattered paint
It's a room I'm renovating; it's a name I got to change
If I get out of California I'm going back to my home state
To tell them all that I made a mistake

And I keep looking for that blindfold faith
Lighting candles to a cynical saint
Who wants the last laugh at the fly trapped in the windowsill tape
You can go right out of your mind trying to escape
From the panicked paradox of day to day
If you can't understand something then it's best to be afraid

The whole world it loves you if you are a chic chameleon
Intersecting circles she could hang with anyone
But when conducting business she would lie about where she's from
Saying, ""Life is how it is not how it was""

I learned to listen felt like I was back at school
She'd talk forever about the phases of the moon
Saying, ""Everything is a cycle, you've got to let it come to you
And when it does, you will know what to do""

Without even knowing I guess I took her advice
Painted her front door it seemed a suitable goodbye
It's not that often but I think of her sometimes
Just something quaint, a couple ships in the night

And they keep moving at a glacial pace
Turning circles in a memory maze
I made a new cast of the death mask that is gonna cover my face
I had to change the combination to the safe
Hide it all behind a wall let people wait
And never trust a heart that is so bent it can't break"

You slipped by and you captured me

But my mind was ill at ease
They were coming to take it away that afternoon
I was all by myself in a mellow mood
Improvising symphonies
My right hand was playing Mozart's minuet
And at the same time my left hand was playing; have a banana; from Carmen
And at the same time my mouth was whistling a sextet from Luicini
And at the same time What do you think my foot was doing?
While keeping time it was cracking walnuts; see I had to eat too.
Then in the midst of all soliloquy
I found it, I found it
The Lost Chord, The Lost Chord!
So let's celebrate I'm feeling great
I'm the guy that found the Lost chord
I'll have my name in the hall of fame; 'cause I went and found that lost chord

Everyone knows Tchaikovsky wasn't recognised for 300 years
Brahms wasn't recognised for 400 years
Beethoven wasn't recognised for 500 years
But I can't wait that long I've only got two changes of clothes!

People said I was mad. but that didn't trouble me
They said Mozart was mad
They said Puccini was mad
They said Louis was mad
Who's Louis? My uncle, he was mad!

So let's celebrate I'm feeling great
I'm the guy that found the Lost chord

You know it wasn't easy finding that Lost chord
Working in my attic I didn't sleep for days and days
I'd be in terrible shape if I hadn't slept nights!
First I put an A flat with a B minor
Then I put a B minor with and F major
Then I put and F minor with a B major
Then I tried an A and a B and a B and a C
And a C and a D and a D and E and an E and a F
And a F and a G; What a piano no apostrophe's!

And this is what I came up with (plays wrong chord)

What's happened that isn't the chord (plays wrong chord)
Neither is that (plays wrong chord)
Neither is that (plays wrong chord)
And neither is that! I lost the chord a catatstrophe
I'm gonna sit down on the keyboard of this piano until the chord is return

(Sits down bum plays the right chord)

That's it the lost chord! I found it, I found by sitting on the piano keyboard
Strange I usually play by ear!

For all the world to see
A heavy cloak and one gloved hand
And no humility

You stand inside the garden
And feast on black cherries
And swallow the manna from heaven
And spit out the seeds

You spread your anger on sharp-edged knives
Cut my skin and make it bleed
Like Pilate in his self-righteousness
You're a traitor and a thief

Choking on your unplanned words
Coughing up your lies
Tumbling from your mouth a flurry
Of broken butterflies

But the blood that flows I cannot hide
That blood that covers me
Nourishes the butterflies
And they are healed and are set free

I wish you had what Ruth possessed
But then I don't expect that of you
Grace and honor and faithfulness
And the love that you refuse

Will you ever learn to just forgive
Will you open your beautiful eyes
And bleed the way Christ did
And fix the broken butterflies"

For the loveless
White sound, oceans of dreams
I won't be another number on the screen
Shhhhh: I wanna hear you scream
I won't be another number
White sound, jet black scream
Vomiting this cold mass of hate
I'm gonna push my love
Through her skull
Through her skull
Through her skull
Through her skull
Through her
I have heard abortion
Stories from the leather nun
Holding hands with dead girls
Hiding from the sun
I did a line
I did a line
I did a line
I did a line
The lines that define begin to gray and fade now
We shoot out the lights and swallow razor blades
I feel nothing for the meat that came before
Liberty, she crawled to me playing the whore"

You're a fool
I'll bet that you believe
They only think that you're cool
And a handsome devil too

But she didn't know what I knew
I laughed with my friend when she got to the end
I knew we were laughing at you
She told me that you made some money
You got yourself framed on the wall
And people come by and they look at your face
And they say it's the fairest of all
Of course you protest, that's what you do best
And you're modest and shy to the end
You're watching them as they're looking at you
And you know it was money well spent

She told me you'd given up drinking
To be with somebody you knew
And you tried to get into the Bible
But it never got into you
You've still got some loyal disciples
I suppose that I'm one of the few
I shouldn't have laughed, 'cause I mean you no harm
But my friend got to me before you
So next time I see you, I'll be pleased to see you
I hope you'll be pleased to see me
I'll visit your picture, I won't have the nerve
To tell them that they've got you all wrong"
931,ML932,Florence + The Machine,Blinding,sad,"Seems that I have been held in some dreaming state
A tourist in the waking world, never quite awake
No kiss, no gentle word could wake me from this slumber
Till I realise that it was you who held me under

Felt it in my fists, in my feet, in the hollows of my eyelids
Shaking through my skull, through my spine and down through my ribs

No more dreaming of the dead as if death itself was undone
No more calling like a crow for a boy, for a body in the garden
No more dreaming like a girl so in love, so in love
No more dreaming like a girl so in love, so in love
No more dreaming like a girl so in love with the wrong world

And I could hear thunder and see the lightning crack
All around the world was waking, I never could go back
'Cause all the walls of dreaming, they were torn wide open
It finally seemed that the spell was broken

Then all my bones began to shake, my eyes flew open
And all my bones began to shake, my eyes flew open

No more dreaming of the dead as if death itself was undone
No more calling like a crow for a boy for a body in the garden
No more dreaming like a girl so in love, so in love
No more dreaming like a girl so in love, so in love
No more dreaming like a girl so in love with the wrong world

Synapse slipping through the hidden door

No more dreaming of the dead as if death itself was undone
No more calling like a crow for a boy for a body in the garden
No more dreaming like a girl so in love, so in love

No more dreaming like a girl so in love with the wrong world

932,ML933,Aberfeldy,Love Is an Arrow,sad,"Love is a thing that I can't describe
It sounds so foolish if I even try
Love is an arrow and it points at you
It tells you what you gotta do

Love is a verb and a noun as well
You find it in a dictionary under 'L'
To give you a description to spell it out
But they don't say what it's all about

Love is a fire that you can't control
It burns in the middle and it leaves a hole
You can fill it up and you don't know when
It's gonna start to burn again

Love is a good way to lose a friend
It's a two-faced liar that you can't defend
Love is a virus that invades your heart
It starts to take it all apart

Love is a shape that you can't define
With an odd set of angles and uneven sides
Your head's that paper and your hearts the pen
Gonna do this sum again
Gonna do this sum again
Gonna do this sum again
Do this sum again

Love is a verb and a noun as well
You find it in the dictionary under 'L'
Love is an arrow and it points at me
It tells me how it's gonna be
It tells me how it's gonna be
It tells me how it's gonna be
It tells me how it's gonna be"
933,ML934,Antony and the Johnsons,The Lake,sad,"In youth's spring, it was my lot
To haunt of the wide earth a spot 
To which I could not love the less
So lovely was the loneliness

Of a wild lake, with black rock bound
And the tall trees that towered around

But when the night had thrown her pall 
Upon that spot as upon all
And the wind would pass me by
In its stilly melody

My infant spirit would awake
To the terror of the lone lake
My infant spirit would awake
To the terror of the lone lake

Yet that terror was not fright
But a tremulous delight
And a feeling undefined
Springing from a darkened mind

Death was in that poisoned wave
And in its gulf, a fitting grave
For him who thence could solace bring
To his dark imagining

Whose wildering thought could even make
An Eden of that dim lake

But when the night had thrown her pall 
Upon that spot as upon all
And the wind would pass me by
In its stilly melody

My infant spirit would awake
To the terror of the lone lake
My infant spirit would awake
To the terror of the lone lake
My infant spirit would awake
To the terror of the lake

Springing from a darkened mind
So lovely was the loneliness
In youth's spring, it was my lot
In its stilly melody

An Eden of that dim lake
An Eden of that dim lake
Lone, lone, lonely
Lone, lone, lonely
Lone, lone, lonely"
934,ML935,Estatic Fear,Chapter I,sad,"The feeble leafs decline,
Enshrined in downing deep
The mourn abandoned plains,
Laid down in sombre sleep
Misty shades engulf the sky
Like past, worn memories
The bird's song fills the whispering breeze
With autumns melody

The lunar pale grim shape
At evening's sight renews
It's silented wail relieves
Repressed thoughts anew
I hear the lonesome choir
Of fortunes past my way
Disdained in fiery weeps
Throughout my every day
These skies I hail and treasure thee,
Most pleasant misery
Not pittes thorn I shelter thine
Mysterious harmony

Draw on most pleasant night
Shade my lorn exposed sight
For my grief's when shadows told
Shall be eased in mist enfold
Why should the foolish's hope
Thy unborn passioned cry
Exhaust unheard
Beneath this pleasant sky?
For if the dusking day declined
Could delight be far behind?"
935,ML936,Joni Mitchell,The Last Time I Saw Richard,sad,"The last time I saw Richard was Detroit in '68
And he told me all romantics meet the same fate someday
Cynical and drunk and boring someone in some dark cafe
""You laugh,"" he said, ""You think you're immune
Go look at your eyes, they're full of moon
You like roses and kisses and pretty men to tell you
All those pretty lies, pretty lies
When you gonna realize they're only pretty lies
Only pretty lies, just pretty lies""

He put a quarter in the Wurlitzer
And he pushed three buttons and the thing began to whirr
And a bar maid came by in fishnet stockings and a bow tie 
And she said, ""Drink up now it's gettin' on time to close""
""Richard you haven't really changed,"" I said
""It's just that now you're romanticizing some pain that's in your head
You got tombs in your eyes, but the songs you punched are dreaming
Listen, they sing of love so sweet, love so sweet
When you gonna go get yourself back on your feet?
Oh love can be so sweet, love so sweet""

Richard got married to a figure skater
And he bought her a dishwasher and a coffee percolator
And he drinks at home now most nights with the TV on
And all the house lights left up bright
I'm gonna blow this damn candle out
I don't want nobody comin' over to my table
I got nothing to talk to anybody about
All good dreamers pass this way some day
Hidin' behind bottles in dark cafes, dark cafes
Only a dark cocoon before I get my gorgeous wings and fly away
Only a phase, these dark cafe days"

And we'll leave this place for the final time

Drown all the fears that we had
These are the things that we'll never understand
This time, fight fire with fire
'Cause baby, tonight the world belongs to you and I

This boy's in love, love
This boy's in love
Under the city
Under the city lights

Don't tell the world what we've known
We've come so far, but there's still a way to go
It's dark; there's no need for lights
When the fire in his eyes is so bright

This boy's in love, love
This boy's in love
Under the city
Under the city lights

Tonight, it's all but nice
Don't wait, too late to die
White girl, white boy, hold tight

We are the something that will not conform

We are the useless by-products of soulless meat
We are all gone we all sing the same tragedy

Open wide and eat the worms of the enemy
We are the enemies of reality, in a world that's unforgiving

Waiting to sanitize bastard tongues
To purify the ignorance that hides the sun
The less you understand the more you're driven

Packaged and processed the masses are force fed
The standards they judge us on swallow the rot we shed

Open wide and eat the worms of the enemy
We are the enemies of reality, in a world that's unforgiving

Breathing dust and decay while I'm sipping
Human trust and betrayal
Losing faith once again
Take my hand my friend, my foe, I am enemy

We are the enemies of reality, in a world that's unforgiving
Open wide, eat the words, become what you most fear"

After all these years you're here and you remember me
She said her old boyfriend packed up and headed back east
But she always knew someday he would go

She just got a new job and she doubts it will last
So let's take a drink and never think and here's to the past
She said it's so funny how life burns out so fast
It's just another wasted day

A boring life in a boring town with the same old crowd
And I used to say that I'd never stay, but I'm rotting here today
With that same old crowd that's always been around
And I always thought I'd be the first to go

That same old crowd that drags me down
Another day in a boring town
That same old crowd that brings me down
A boring life in a boring town

Just talked to this girl who used to live on my street
After all these years you're here and it's still just you and me
Sometimes I can't believe after all these years
I just think I'll never leave here

She said it's so funny how life burns out so fast
So let's take another drink and here's to the past

That same old crowd that drags me down
Another day in a boring town
That same old crowd that brings me down
A boring life in a boring town

And remember when they'd look through you
And they'd look past me?
We were the ones they said would always leave
So when you go, just think of me, think of me

A boring life in a boring town with the same old crowd
And I used to say that I'd never stay, but I'm rotting here today
With that same old crowd that's always been around
And I always thought that, and I always thought that

944,ML945,Sebadoh,Soul and Fire,sad,"It's all a matter of soul and fire
Infatuation or true desire
The thrill of discovery, divine intervention
Cruel, cruel change, pain of rejection
As you walk away, think of all the joy we shared
If you decide you need me, I'll be wondering if I care
Not there to soothe your soul, friend to tender friend
I think our love is coming to an end
King persuader, congratulations
Share her heart, you bought her soul
Princess confusion, come to me again
Saying goodbye was so much fun
When you walk away, feel the freedom in your heart
There's a joy in letting go, free to find a love apart
When I lose control, I need a kind, forgiving friend
But I think our love is coming to an end
I know our love is coming to an end"

Lost sight of everything tonight my presence
Blacken their patterns
A pock in the healthy and calm

Their scorn behind your back
My promise would put them down
No trace of reverence left
Immemorial fire in their eyes

I would perish at the given signal
At the slightest touch from my soul
Tainted prophet in flesh
For all the plagued and lost

Dripping sin, desicion in stalemate
Dare to feel death at hand
Surprised me with its voice
Through the forest came the morn

Across the leafy pathway
Their deeds smeared in blood
For all to behold
The council of the cross

Must have sensed my coming
The pest through the air
With despise for squalor
Lashing out at the poor

I turned away my eyes
In pallor escape from the end
Fading time to leave from here
And less to fulfill my task
She would be safe and firm
Nothing of this is in vain
Taken away from stifling grace
And saved from the past"

Where troubles melt like lemon drops

We're safe inside this house of light
We make up our own storyline

Around the neighborhood
They stare and grin
As if they live their lives
Just to help maintain the state we're in
But when we fight
Then those hungry wolves close in
We're one thoughtless word away

From poison skies
And severed heads
And pain and lies
So follow me
I'll hold you tight
We'll build a life together
In the Great Pagoda of Funn

This magic soon will fade
Without a doubt
We'll have to work my love
Just to keep the flame from going out

Then these walls will fall away
And we'll find we're in the realm

Of psycho-moms
And dying stars
And dirty bombs

951,ML952,Jens Lekman,Friday Night at the Drive-In Bingo,happy,"In a tiny, tiny southern Swedish country town
Two acres of field and a gas station
Riding on my moped, looking for fun
Staring into the blood-red sun
Oh, the country road is a boulevard
With neon lights and night-open bars
In my jacket, pack of playing cards
Just jacks, jokers, and a queen of hearts

My heart is beating, beating like Ringo
As I pull into the drive-in bingo

Why do the people in the country want to look like the people in the city
When the people in the city aren't the slightest pretty?
I want the people in the country to wear flannel shirts
And saggy jeans all covered in dirt
I want the people in the country to be open and kind
But most times I've met those with a narrow mind
With a big black dog to bite your behind
If they ever find out you're not one of their kind

All these thoughts as I open up a zingo
Friday night at the drive-in bingo

So this is what they do out here for fun?
They play bingo and let their engines run
Tonight's jackpot is a pig, hey, that's criminal
G-42, ooh, I'm going diagonal
I'm gonna gather up a few of my friends
As many fits into an army tent
Just bring your savings and a bottle of wine
To Friday night's reversal of time

This little southwest village shouldn't cost that much
Maybe a handful of silver or a hundred bucks
We could have wild, wild parties in that big old lodge
And the windmill's perfect for movies and such
We could fake our deaths to get insurance money
And take on hippie names, I'd be Snowphish, you'd be Sunny
We could start a little farm with little white bunnies
Just 'cause watching them copulate is very funny

There's a cow and an ostrich just waiting for you
A glass of apple cider just waiting for you
The smell of 1952 just waiting for you
And all I'm doing here is just waiting for you

A daydream, I'm caught up in limbo
Friday night at the drive-in bingo"

Dollar bill but I go to shows
And make you holla still
I gotta pay my bills and it's not like Prada will
I go to the check cashing spot
Will I always be a have not
Never gonna live in no lavish spot
Always gonna live at home with mom and pop

I'm just tryna be honest that why I say this
Hopefully radio plays this I doubt it though
Yo pass that Olde English

Yeah I be rockin' the discotech
Every single night no self respect
Sometimes I feel like I party way too much
Premieres openings and shows and such but
What else is a girl to do
Go home by myself at 2
In the AM I'm sayin' I'm not playin'
I'm doin' the same stupid shit and it's day in day out
I know that there's gotta be a way out
But I keep drinking and I just stay out
At the hot spots with superstars and the hardrocks
I wish that I could disappear to the boondocks
Why not, maybe I'll hire me a pilot
To take me away to the shade and I'll stay
Get a slice at Ray's like we did when we was kids
Something's gotta give real soon but it's not this

On the real I be hatin' myself sometimes
I know you do too but it's okay sometimes
I'm tryin' to escape the grind sometimes
It ain't gonna get better if I do some lines so
Enough with the parties and bullshit
I go to the parties and bullshit
It never gets better when I do this shit
So stressed I wanna get up and quit
It's like maybe tonight's the night and
Maybe if I socialize I'll feel all right but those
Never seem to be the best laid plans
Never did I dream I'd go to foreign lands I just
Wanna lay in creamy sands
Doing nothin' all day with my dreamy man maybe
Buy that house across from the projects
So I can stay trading gossip like stock tips

It's not at the after party
It's not in the hotel lobby
It's not in magazines
And It's not even in my dreams
The things that I need
Ain't in the vip

I gotta open up before you leave

Baby it's time to get up on track
And give it all back to you
I know that you love me
You're always there for me
Baby it's time to get up on track
And give it all back to you
I could lose you forever
And it's now or never

Oh no oh no oh no oh no
We spend the entire day
How you always knew what to say oh
You never asked to stay
And I can't believe that I couldn't see
Gotta open up before you leave me lonely oh

But be there when you need me

Whisperin' beside me
When I say my prayers
When I say my prayers

He come around
He come up, he come around
Ain't that I mind workin'
Workin' means travelers
Journeyin' together
To the promised land

But old man sorrow
Mountin' all the way with me
Tell' me that I'm old now
Since I lose my man
Since I lose my man

Since I lose my man"

In the stars tonight 
Angels guide you home 
With the silver light

A distant silhouette 
The haze begins to clear 
I feel you throwing me 
To the beat of my heart

And I hear your voice through the distance 
Calling my name 
And do you hear the answer from the still of my soul 
Wasted until this day of reunion

Seven years ago 
I watched you leave 
How could you know the vamp 
The time won't veer

We walk down separate ways 
Toward those steps we missed 
We were always meant for these 
Moments from now

And I hear a voice through the distance 
Calling my name 
And do you hear the answer from the still of my soul 
Wasted until this day of reunion

And I hear a voice through the distance

And I hear your voice through the distance 
Calling my name 
And do you hear the answer from the still of my soul 
Wasted until this day of reunion

We come and go 
To the beat of a heart 
To the beat of my soul

We come and go 
We come and go 
To the beat of my heart

979,ML980,Nas,One Mic,angry,"(Speaking softly, gradually getting louder)
One time... yeah... yeah...

Yo, all I need is one mic, one beat, one stage
One nigga front, my face on the front page
Only if I had one gun, one girl and one crib
One God to show me how to do things his son did
Pure, like a cup of virgin blood; mixed with
151, one sip'll make a nigga flip
Writin names on my hollow tips, plottin shit
Mad violence who I'm gon' body, this hood politics
Ackowledge it, leave bodies chopped in garbages
Seeds watch us, grow up and try to follow us
Police watch us roll up and try knockin' us
One knee I ducked, could it be my time is up
But my luck, I got up, the cop shot again
Bus stop glass bursts, a fiend drops his heineken
Richochetin between the spots that I'm hidin in
Blackin out as I shoot back, fuck gettin' hit!
This is my hood I'ma rep, to the death of it
Till everybody come home, little niggaz is grown
Hoodrats, don't abortion your womb, we need more warriors soon
Sip from the star sun and the moon
In this life of police chases street sweepers and coppers
Stick-up kids with no conscience, leavin' victims with doctors
If you really think you ready to die, with nines out
This is what nas is bout, nigga the time is now!

(Whispering again)
Yo, all I need is one mic...
All I need is one mic... that's all I need
All I need is one mic... all I need niggaz
All I need is one mic... yeah

(Gradually getting louder)
All I need is one blunt, one page, and one pen
One prayer - tell God forgive for one sin
Matter fact maybe more than one, look back
At all the hatred against me, fuck alla them
Jesus died at age 33, there's thirty-three shots
From twin glocks there's sixteen apiece, that's thirty-two
Which means, one of my guns was holdin' 17
Twenty-seven hit your crew, six went into you
Everybody gotta die sometime; hope your funeral
Never gets shot up, bullets tear through the innocent
Nothin' is fair, niggaz roll up, shootin from wheelchairs
My heart is racin, tastin revenge in the air
I let the shit slide for too many years, too many times
Now I'm strapped with a couple of macs, too many nines
If y'all niggaz really wit me get busy load up the semis
Do more than just hold it explode the clip until you empty
There's nothin' in our way - they bust, we bust, they rust, we rust
Led flyin, feel it? I feel it in my gut
That we take these bitches to war, lie 'em down
'Cause we stronger now my nigga the time is now!

(Whispering again)
All I need is one mic... that's all I need, that's all I need
All I need is one mic... there's nuttin else in the world
All I need is one mic... that's all a nigga need to do his thing y'know
All I need is one mic...

(Starting loud this time, getting quieter)
All I need is one life, one try, one breath I'm one man
What I stand for speaks for itself, they don't understand
Or wanna see me on top, too egotistical
Talkin' all that slick shit, the same way these bitches do
Wonder what my secrets is, niggaz'll move on you
Only if they know, what your weakness is I have none
Too late to grab guns I'm blastin 'cause I'm a cool nigga
Thought I wouldn't have that ass done? fooled you niggaz
What you call a infinite brawl, eternal souls clashin
War gets deep, some beef is everlastin
Complete with thick scars, brothers knifin each other
Up in prison yards, drama, where does it start?
You know the block was ill as a youngster
Every night it was like a, cop would get killed body found in the dumpster
For real a hustler, purchased my range, niggaz throwin' dirt on my name
Jealous cause fiends got they work and complain
Bitches left me 'cause they thought I was finished
Shoulda knew she wasn't true she came to me when her man caught a sentence
Diamonds are blindin, I never make the same mistakes
Movin with a change of pace, lighter load, see now the king is straight
Swellin my melon cause none of these niggaz real
Heard he was, tellin' police, how can a kingpin squeal?
This is crazy, I'm on the right track I'm finally found
You need some soul searchin, the time is now

All I need is one mic... yeah, yeah yeah yeah
All I need is one mic... that's all I ever needed in this world, fuck cash
All I need is one mic... fuck the cars, the jewelry
All I need is one mic... to spread my voice to the whole world"

Severely a mental disorder
Where reality is highly distorted
Psychosis = weaken the mind,
Incline to small doses as we approach this
Ever endless quest for a vengeance,
While those who expose and pretend this
Life is just a bowl of cherries,
A bunch of fairies screaming to be scary

It's propaganda, sell it to the innocent
Oh yeah they're buying it, just tell them to rebel again

I'm a maniac, a hard one to handle
You better come packing more than a scandal
Fucked over for the times I've been grateful
Fucked over led to times I've been hateful
Main attraction, fuck you in your pussy mouth
Come again friend, now we got some action
On and on is the name that they gave me
And your misery came here to save me

As the world is slowly turning
I know that in letting go
I'm learning how to live through a life I have to give

We painted white-wash everything
When all that remains are shadows of the stains
Tell me where did we go wrong can we just move on

Hello from the world below
I'm watching the sun burning
As the world is slowly turning
I know that in letting go I'm learning how to live
Through a life I have to give

Hello to the world below
Watching the world spinning
This night seems so unending
I follow to a place I know
That's only the beginning start over after ending"

Send out an SOS plea; come quickly, I'm marooned in Monkeyland
Is there anyone there who understands me? Anyone at all

I'm idly staring at the sky. Did anybody hear me sigh?
A million stars, a moving sight. To all you out there hearing me tonight

It's just a trick of the light. Yeah, it's just a trick of the light

I have to know what is real and what is illusion
Oh, how does it feel beyond this confusion? Is there anyone there?

Do I dismiss this with a sigh? (Oh yes, you must from time to time)
And let the answers pass me by (no questions set to bend the mind)
Is my creator a God or a man? (yes, yours too). Does someone somewhere care or understand?

It's just a trick of the light. Yeah, it's just a trick of the light

I have to know what is real and what is illusion
Tell me how does it feel beyond this confusion?

For all the tricks of the light. Yeah, for all the tricks of the light out there tonight, tonight

I have to know what is real and what is illusion
Oh, how does it feel beyond this confusion? Is there anyone there?

Life's an optical illusion. Like other optical illusions, oh, beware

997,ML998,Bauhaus,Slice Of Life,sad,"Her gaze hit the side of mine
So I opened it out
To destroy what you thought was difference

So I lied to you once again
So I painted over you once again
So I die before you once again
'What's the difference'

Come clearly where the flavour is
Seen here in black and white
You've got two seconds baby boy
In burning light white light
'What's the difference'

Clear up what you are
Burn out these eyes
Rip up this place and scream
'I am your slice of life' (four times)

Shivering under lamposts
Shivering under glass
Your standing on charisma again
God knows it cannot last
'What's the difference'

Ice inside your body
Blood inside your soul

Yet still twelve faces stand around
Hugging your skinny bones
'What's the difference'

So clear up what you are
Burn out these eyes, rip up this place and scream
'I am your slice of life' (four times)

And the money is brighter with a wider smile
And the problem expands inside your head

998,ML999,Johnny Cash,Sunday Morning Coming Down,sad,"Well, I woke up Sunday morning
With no way to hold my head that didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't bad
So I had one more for dessert
Then I fumbled in my closet through my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
Then I washed my face and combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs to meet the day

I'd smoked my mind the night before
With cigarettes and the songs I'd been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Playin' with a can that he was kicking
Then I walked across the street
And caught the Sunday smell of someone's fryin' chicken
And it took me back to somethin'
That I'd lost somewhere, somehow along the way

On a Sunday morning sidewalk
I'm wishing, Lord, that I was stoned
'Cause there's something in a Sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothin' short of dyin'
That's half as lonesome as the sound
Of a sleepin' city sidewalk
And Sunday mornin' comin' down

In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughin' little girl that he was swingin'
And I stopped beside a Sunday school
And listened to the songs they were singin'
Then I headed down the street
And somewhere far away a lonely bell was ringin'
And it echoed through the canyon
Like the disappearing dreams of yesterday

On a Sunday morning sidewalk
I'm wishing, Lord, that I was stoned
'Cause there's something in a Sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothin' short of dyin'
That's half as lonesome as the sound
Of a sleepin' city sidewalk
And Sunday mornin' comin' down"

I almost dropped out to move to L.A.
Where I was almost famous for almost a day

And I almost had you
But I guess that doesn't cut it
Almost loved you
I almost wished you would have loved me, too

I almost held up a grocery store
Where I almost did five years and then seven more
'Cause I almost got popped for a fight with a thug
'Cause he almost made off with a bunch of the drugs
That I almost got hooked on, 'cause you ran away
And I wish I would've had the nerve to ask you to stay

And I almost had you
But I guess that doesn't cut it
Almost had you
And I didn't even know it

You kept me guessing
And now I'm destined
To spend my time missing you
I almost wish you would have loved me, too

Here I go thinkin' 'bout all the things I could have done
I'm gonna need a forklift, 'cause all the baggage weighs a ton (baggage weighs a ton)
I know we had our problems, I can't remember one.

I almost forgot to say something else
And if I can't fit it in, I'll keep it all to myself
I almost wrote a song about you today
But I tore it all up and then I threw it away

It's gotten so bad, there's just no more anger
So now it seem like we can't get no further
I can't believe I'll be bright for another

She'll be mine too, I get off
I'll be the fuse that she blows

Under the moon and with the girl that's in your place

They're taking her children away
Because they said she was not a good mother
They're taking her children away
Because of the things that they heard she had done
The black Air Force sergeant was not the first one
And all of the drugs she took, every one, every one

And I am the Water Boy, the real game's not over here
But my heart is overflowin' anyway
I'm just a tired man, no words to say
But since she lost her daughter
It's her eyes that fill with water
And I am much happier this way

They're taking her children away
Because they said she was not a good mother
They're taking her children away
Because number one was the girl friend from Paris
The things that they did - ah - they didn't have to ask us
And then the Welshman from India, who came here to stay

They're taking her children away
Because they said she was not a good mother
They're taking her children away
Because of the things she did in the streets
In the alleys and bars, no she couldn't be beat
That miserable rotten slut couldn't turn anyone away

I am the Water Boy, the real game's not over here

But your steps are too small 

Now and again 
Take me down a peg 
You know I can get so lost 
Even if it's true 
From anyone but you 
Nothing would get through my wall 

I lose touch in your goals 
It's vertigo 
And your words are like 
Music to the beast 
It's all lights and smoke 
It's political 
And my grip remains true 
Though the line may swerve"

Weren't you born with muddy feet?
Hoarse, in high tops, totally lost
Those two streets will never meet

I will never see the sun

One for nothing, all for one
Spadina, St. George, Bay and Yonge

So the map says 'you are here'
Waltzing in a garbage pile
Sweating like a weather's vein
Coughing thunder, sneezing rain

I will never see the sun
Spadina, St. George, Bay, and Yonge
One for nothing, all for one
Spadina, St. George, Bay and Yonge

There's a rag just up the street
Eats his history to keep warm
Got some blankets, got some bags
Screams confessions, shouts in vain

Delicious and piping hot in only 3 microwave minutes.

Look, it comes with a toy, hehe, I like that

Just enjoy the gritty crunch, it tastes just like chicken
Wrappers of many bite sizes
Man, are you freakin' blind? That's a rock
All mixed in the pot for momma's homemade from scratch, well, not quite
Toasted over flames, they be tasting quite right

If there is a Hell, I'll see you there

He flexed his muscles to keep his flock of sheep in line
He made a virus that would kill off all the swine
His perfect kingdom of killing, suffering and pain
Demands devotion, atrocities done in his name

With all the love I have inside
I can't deny

I just can't let it die
'Cause her heart's just like mine
And she holds her pain inside

So if you ask me why
She wouldn't say goodbye
I know somewhere inside

There is a special light
Still shining bright
And even on the darkest night
She can't deny

So if she's somewhere near me
I hope to God she hears me
There's no one else could ever make me feel I'm so alive
I hoped she'd never leave me
Please God, you must believe me
I've searched the universe and found myself within her eyes

They say it's all a lie
So what's the use of my
Confessions to a crime
Of passions that won't die
In my heart

I soon was finding out
You are the roots that sleep beneath my feet 
And hold the earth in place

Words are spoken
The water runs away 
And I hear your name
No, nothing has changed

There was this book I read and loved
The story of a ship
Who sailed around the world and found
That nothing else exists
Beyond his own two sails
And wooden shell 
And what is held within
All else is sure to pass
We clutch and grasp
And debate what's truly permanent
But when the wind starts to shift
There's no argument

I sing and drink and sleep on floors
And try hard not to be annoyed
By all these people worrying about me
So when I'm suffering through some awful drive
You occasionally cross my mind
It's my hidden hope that you are still among them
Well are you?

Oh, you are the roots that sleep beneath my feet 
And hold the earth in place
Each time a curtain opens
Sunlight pours in
A lifetime melts away
And we share a name
On some picturesque grave"

But when storms quicken one cannot placate

Beside our waiting graves
As war roars about out precious land
Seeking cause to subjugate

Tonight the world will fear our names

Stay my feeble heart
Our deaths will be the start
Of something glorious and vain

There is no fanaticism as virile as faith
To the blind his words are clear
Suffer not the infidel! Suffer not the infidel!
Assure your place in paradise here

Winged seraphim hold love's trembling hand
Beside her tiny grave
I will avenge her, do or damned
Her sacred mother did the same

I went to see her dance one day
In a play by a wailing wall
Now she is gone
But the song lives on
Zealous and maniacal

The Eastern sword must fall

Tonight the world will fear our names

Something knows me

But it feels like something dead and cold 

I can feel it waiting 
But it waits for something in my soul 

Sometimes I call out for you, and sometimes I'm afraid 

So I beg God 
For salvation, for an angel 
Every night 

And I ask God 
Can He forgive me? 
And I want to believe 

I think I hear it laughing 
But it sounds like my voice lost and old 

I think it showed me Heaven 
And now I know why I'm scared to die 

Am I a fool in the dark, I don't know 
Am I the ghost in my dreams, I don't know 
Am I a shadow of life, I don't know 
Am I afraid of the truth, I don't know 

Sometimes I call out for you, and sometimes I'm afraid 

So I ask for 
One small mercy?

The face is hanging out on a spring

And I give in to my pretendings

Without me knowing 
They melt my heart to stone

And I hear your words that I made up
You say my name like there could be an us
I best tidy up my head, I'm the only one in love
I'm the only one in love

Each and every time I turn around to leave
I feel my heart begin to burst and bleed
So desperately I try to link it with my head 
But instead I fall back to my knees
As you tear your way right through me
I forgive you once again 
Without me knowing
You've burnt my heart to stone

And I hear your words that I made up
You say my name like there could be an us
I best tidy up my head, I'm the only one in love

Why do you steal my hand
Whenever I'm standing my own ground?
You build me up, then leave me dead

You are my sacrifice

Something that would make me never want another
Something that would make it so that nothing matters
All would be clear then

But I guess I'll have to settle for a few brief moments
And watch it all dissolve into a single second
And try to write it down into a perfect sonnet
Or one foolish line

'Cause that's all that you'll get
So you'll have to accept
You are here then you're gone

But I believe that lovers should be tied together
Thrown into the ocean in the worst of weather
Left there to drown
Left there to drown in their innocence

But as for me, I'm coming to the final chapter
I read all of the pages and there's still no answer
Only all that was before, I know must soon come after
That's the only way it can be

So I stand in the sun
And I breathe with my lungs
Trying to spare me the weight of the truth

Saying everything you've ever seen was just a mirror
You've spent your whole life sweating in an endless fever
And laying in a bathtub full of freezing water
Wishing you were a ghost

But once you knew a girl and you named her lover
Danced with her in kitchens through the greenest summer
Autumn came, she disappeared, you can't remember
Where she said she was going to

But you know that she's gone
'Cause she left you a song
That you don't want to sing

Singing I believe that lovers should be chained together
Thrown into a fire with their songs and letters
Left there to burn
Left there to burn in their arrogance

But as for me, I'm coming to my final failure
I've killed myself with changes trying to make things better
Ended up becoming something other
Than what I had planned to be

All right

Now I believe that lovers should be draped in flowers
And laid entwined together on a bed of clover
Left there to sleep
Left there to dream of their happiness"

One little smile, and after a while, a longing to forget
One little heartache left as a token
One little plaything carelessly broken

Remember?

Remember you vowed
By all the stars above you
Remember?

Remember we found a lonely spot
And after I learned to care a lot

You promised that you'd forget me not
But you forgot
To remember

Into my dreams you wandered it seems, and then there came a day
You loved me too; my dreams had come true, and all the world was May
But soon the May-time turned to December
You had forgotten; do you remember?"

Your body's waiting for his whips
The taste of leather on your lips

Hear the cry of war, louder than before
With his sword in hand to control the land
Crushing metal strikes on this frightening night
Fall onto your knees for the phantom lord

Victims falling under chains
You hear them crying death pains
The fists of terrors breaking through
Now there's nothing you can do

Hear the cry of war, louder than before

Fall onto your knees for the phantom lord

The phantom lord has never failed
Smoke is lifting from the ground

Nothin' worse could ever happen,
But seeing you with someone else proved that I was wrong.
And when your eyes met mine,
I knew that you were gone forever,
Along with all the reasons, I had for hanging on.
I'd be better off in a pine box,
On a slow train back to Georgia,
Or in the grey walls of a prison doing time.
I think I'd rather die,
And go to hell and face the devil,
Than to lie here with you and him together on my mind.

I always thought that someday,
We might get back together.
I just thought you needed time to spread your wings and fly.
But when I saw the lovin' way,
You held onto each other,
It was all that I could do, not to break right down and cry.

I'd be better off in a pine box,
On a slow train back to Georgia,
Or in the grey walls of a prison doing time.

When she gets paid, true religion gets it all
If they fit right.

She's a little bit manic, completely organic
Doesn't panic for the most part.

She's old enough to know, and young enough not to say no
To any chance that she gets for home plate tickets to see the Mets.
Like everybody, she's in over her head,
Dreads Feds, Grateful Dead, and doesn't take meds.

She's a Gemini Capricorn
Thinks all men are addicted to porn.
I don't agree with her half the time,
But, damn I'm glad she's mine.

Her eyes, that's where hope lies.
That's where blue skies
Meet the sunrise.
Her eyes, that's where I go
When I go home.

She got the kinda strength that every man wishes he had.
She loved Michael Jackson up until he made Bad.

Tells me that she lives about a hundred lives,
Scares me to death when she thinks and drives,
Says cowboy hats make her look fat,
And I'm so glad she's mine.

Her eyes, that's where hope lies.
That's where blue skies
Meet the sunrise.
Her eyes, that's where I go
When I go home.

She doesn't know the word 'impossible'
Don't care where I've been and doesn't care where we're goin' to.
She takes me as I am, and that ain't easy.
She's beautiful. So beautiful.

And sometimes I think she's truly crazy.
And I love it.

Her eyes, that's where hope lies.
That's where blue skies
Always meet the sunrise.
Her eyes, that's where I go
When I go home.

Her eyes, that's where hope lies.

Always meet the sunrise.

Your culture of greed has got to end

Now we're laying in the mud
Looking up above
Tear water just ah drop from the sky
They try to keep us in the mud
Separating us from love
But me nah go let dem conquer de I

From the go you had my button pressed
Did the tea-time of your soul
Make you long for wilder days?
Did you never let Jack Kerouac
Wash over you in waves?

Sibella, we don't make sense together
But my heart's with you
Sibella, I found myself
Strange but true, strange but true

Some say you can learn a lot from books
Thrill right to second-hand living
Life is just as deadly as it looks
But fiction is more forgiving

You took chances well within your means
Salon hair and creases in your jeans
All those lonely winters long
Did you really think it through
Did you really ache for me like I really ached for you

Sibella, we don't make sense together

The carnival drums all mad in the air
Grim reapers and skeletons and a missionary bell,
O where do we go now but nowhere?

In a colonial hotel we fucked up the sun,
And then we fucked it down again
Well the sun comes up and the sun goes down,
Going 'round and around to nowhere

The kitten that padded and purred on my lap,
Now swipes at my face with the paw of a bear
I turn the other cheek and you lay into that,
O where do we go now but nowhere?

O wake up, my love, my lover, wake up,
O wake up, my love, my lover, wake up

Across clinical benches with nothing to talk,
Breathing tea and biscuits and the Serenity Prayer
While the bones of our child crumble like chalk,
O where do we go now but nowhere?

I remember a girl so bold and so bright,
Loose-limbed an laughing and brazen and dare
Sits gnawing her knuckles in the chemical light,
O where do we go now but nowhere?

You come for me now with a cake that you've made,
Ravaged avenger with a clip in your hair
Full of glass and bleach an my old razor blades,
O where do we go now but nowhere?

O wake up, my love, my lover, wake up,
O wake up, my love, my lover, wake up

If they'd give me my clothes back then I could go home,
From this fresh, this clean, antiseptic air
Behind the locked gates and old donkey moans,
O where do we go now but nowhere?

Around the duck pond we grimly mope,
Gloomily and mournfully we go round again
And one more doomed time and without much hope,
Going 'round and around to nowhere

From the balcony we watched the carnival band,
The crack of the drum a little child did scare
I can still feel his tiny fingers pressed in may hand,
O where do we go now but nowhere?

If I could relive one day of my life,
If I could relive just a single one
You on the balcony, my future wife,
O who could have known, but no one?

O wake up, my love, my lover, wake up,
O wake up, my love, my lover, wake up"

I wasn't even sure it were her at first; I was ready to walk away but she smiled and called me over and we said hello for a bit. When we back to our tables we were trying not to look over at each other and told our friends to stop staring. I didn't see her for the rest of the night, but by closing time the beers kicked in so I go up and speak to her and we end up talking about our new homes, our new jobs and our new birds.

She says she's been going out with him now for about two and a half years, but they don't live together so he'd never find out. And you think about chasing her about school when you were wee and lying in your bed and listening to love songs and pretending they were about you. and the first time you asked her out she said no but one night you went to a wedding and when you came back to the pub she's changed her mind and you went out. You remember the way she swung her arms when she held your hand but you can't remember how she kissed and now you've got the chance to find out.

But you have to remember there's this other kiss. She's at home, wondering where you are and what you're doing. And you work hard on this kiss and you know it inside out; it's as much yours as it is hers, and it took a long time to get right, it took months of practice and months of embarrassment but now you've got it perfected and you've been looking forward to that kiss all week.

You can see her breath in the air between your faces as you stand in the leaves and she just asks you straight out if you want to come and stay at her flat. But you make sure you get separate taxis and you go home and there might be a slight regret and you might wonder what you missed, but you have to remember the kiss you worked so hard on. And you'll know you've done the right thing."

There's nothing to learn from that vacant voice
That sails to me across the line
From the ridiculous to the sublime

But really can't you find somebody else that you can ring and tell
Did you ever
Care for me?
Were you ever
There for me?

1144,ML1145,Jonathan Coulton,Ikea,happy,"Long ago in days of yore
It all began with a god named Thor.
There were Vikings and boats
And some plans for a furniture store.
It's not a bodega, it's not a mall
And they sell things for apartments smaller than mine
As if there were apartments smaller than mine

Ikea: just some oak and some pine and a handful of Norsemen
Ikea: selling furniture for college kids and divorced men
Everyone has a home
And if you don't have a home you can buy one there

So rent a car or take the bus
Lay your cash down and put your trust
In the land where the furniture folds to a much smaller size
Billy the bookcase says hello
And so does a table whose name is Ingo
And the chair is a ladder-back birch but his friends call him Karl

Ikea: just some oak and some pine and a handful of Norsemen
Ikea: selling furniture for college kids and divorced men
Everyone has a home
And if you don't have a home you can buy one there

Ikea: plywood, brushed steel
Ikea: meatballs, tasty
Ikea: Allen wrenches
All of them for free
All of them for me

I'm sorry I said Ikea sucks
I just bought a table for 60 bucks
And a chair and a lamp
And a shelf and some candles for you
I was a doubter just like you
Till I saw the American dream come true
In New Jersey, they got a god damned Swedish parade

Ikea: just some oak and some pine and a handful of Norsemen
Ikea: selling furniture for college kids and divorced men

1146,ML1147,Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds,Hallelujah,sad,"On the first day of May I took to the road
I'd been staring out the window most of the morning
I'd watched the rain claw at the glass
And a vicious wind blew hard and fast
I should have taken it as a warning
As a warning As a warning
As a warning

I'd given my nurse the weekend off
My meals were ill prepared
My typewriter had turned mute as a tomb
And my piano crouched in the corner of my room
With all its teeth bared
All its teeth bared All its teeth bared
All its teeth bared.

Hallelujah Hallelujah
Hallelujah Hallelujah

I left my house without my coat
Something my nurse would not have allowed
And I took the small roads out of town
And I passed a cow and the cow was brown
And my pyjamas clung to me like a shroud
Like a shroud Like a shroud
Like a shroud

There rose before me a little house
With all hope and dreams kept within
A woman's voice close to my ear
Said, ""Why don't you come in here?""
""You looked soaked to the skin""
Soaked to the skin Soaked to the skin
Soaked to the skin

Hallelujah Hallelujah
Hallelujah Hallelujah

I turned to the woman and the woman was young
I extended a hearty salutation
But I knew if my nurse had been here
She would never in a thousand years
Permit me to accept that invitation
Invitation That invitation
That invitation

Now, you might think it wise to risk it all
Throw caution to the reckless wind
But with her hot cocoa and her medication
My nurse had been my one salvation
So I turned back home
I turned back home I turned back home
Singing my song

Hallelujah
The tears are welling in my eyes again
Hallelujah
I need twenty big buckets to catch them in
Hallelujah
And twenty pretty girls to carry
Them down
Hallelujah
And twenty deep holes to bury them in
Hallelujah
The tears are welling in my eyes again
Hallelujah
I need twenty big buckets to catch them in
Hallelujah
And twenty pretty girls to carry them down
Hallelujah
And twenty deep holes to bury them in"

And everything I used to be has spiraled into insanity
Every night, I sweat and bleed in her name 

The dark wave comes, sanity slips away
She screams from the alcove, ""I am the dog!""

She was born in the year of the dog
She never would betray the world I never saw
Blinded eyes that never see, shattered into infinity
Every night, the dream is the same

She screams from the alcove, ""I am the dog!""

I used to listen to rappers flow
Talkin' 'bout the way
They rocked the mic at the disco
I liked how that shit was goin' down
With my own sound
So I tried to write rhymes
Somethin' like them, my boys said,
""That ain't you Ice,

That shit sounds like HIM.""
So I sat back, thought up a new track
Didn'T fantasize, kicked the pure
Facts. Motherfuckers got scared
'Cause they was unprepaired
Who would tell it how it relly was?
Who dared?
A motherfucker from the West Coast
L.A. South Central fool
Where the Crips and the Bloods play
When I wrote about parties
It didn't fit
Six in the Mornin'
That was the real shit

O.G. Original Gangster

When I wrote about parties
Someone always died
When I tried to write happy
Yo I knew I lied, I lived a life of crime
Why play ya blind?
A simple look
And anyone with two cents
Would know I'm
A hardcore player from the streets
Rappin' bout hardcore topics
Over hardcore drum beats
A little different
Than the average though
Jet you through the fast lane
Drop ya on death row
Cause anybody who's been there
Knows that life ain't sho lovely
On the blood-soaked fast track
That invincible shit don't work
Throw ya in a joint
You'll be comin' out feet first
So I blast the mic with my style
Sometimes I'm ill
The other times buck wild
But the science is always there
I'd be a true sucker
If I acted like I didn'T care
I rap for brothers just like myself
Dazed by the game
In a quest for extreme wealth
But I kick it to you hard and real
One wrong move, and your caps peeled
I ain't no super hero
I ain't no Marvel Comic
But when it comes to game I'm atomic
At droppin' it straight
Point blank and untwisted
No imagination needed, 'cause I lived it
This ain't no fuckin' joke
This shit is real to me
I'm Ice-T

O.G.

Two weeks ago I was out at the disco
Two brothers stepped up to me
And said
""Hey yo, Ice
We don't think you're down
What set ya claimin'?""
E drew the Glock, yo my set's aimin'!
Dumb motherfucker
Try to roll on me, please!
I'm protected by a thousand emcees
And hoodlums and hustlers
And bangers with Jeri curls
We won't even count the girls
'Cause they got my back
And I got theirs too
Fight for the streets
When I'm on Oprah or Donahue
They try to sweat a nigga
But they just didn'T figure
What my wit's as quick as a hair trigger
""He's not your everyday-type
Prankster.""

I'm Ice-T, the original gangster

So step to me
If you think that you're ready to
Got on your bullet proof?
Well mine's goin' right through
This ain't no game to me
It's hollow fame to me
Without respect from streets
So I don't claim be
The hardest motherfucker on earth
Catch me slippin, I can even get worked
But I don'T slip that often
There's a coffin
Waitin' for the brother
Who comes off soft when
The real fuckin' shit goes down
Take a look around
All them pussies can be found
They talk a mean fight
But fight like hoes
I'm from South Central, fool
Where everything goes
Snatch you out your car so fast
You'll get whiplash
Numbers on your roof top
For when the copters pass
Gang bangers
Don't carry no switch blades
Every kid's got a Tec 9 or a
Hand grenade
Thirty-seven killed
Last week in a crack war

Hostges tied up
And shot in a liquor store
Nobody gives a fuck
""The children have to go to school.""
Well, moms, good luck
Cause the shit's fucked up bad
I use my pad and pen
And my lyrics break out mad
I try to write about fun
Andthe goodtimes

And destroys the rhyme

Une lueur scintille dans la nuit,
Et l'ange tombe du haut des cieux,
Les ailes déchirées par son dieu,
Une goutte de plus parmi les pluies.

Son corps a traversé les nuages,
Pour atterrir sur terre, tremblant,
D'un ange, il ne reste plus que le visage, 
La pureté de son teint blanc.

L'homme pauvre sera attristé,
Mais du paradis est venue la haine,
Il ne reste plus, sur son visage blême,
Que malheurs et souffrances ignorés.

Oublier ma douleur et Marie,
DéjÃ  je sens naître de la mort l'ennui,
Mais des autres mondes j'ai perdu la foi"".

A light twinkles in the night
And the angel falls from the heavens
His wings torn by his God
Another drop among the rains

His shell has crossed the clouds
To land on earth, shivering,
Of an angel only remains his face,
The purity of his white complexion

The poor man shall be sad
But from Heaven came hatred
On his pale face only remain
Ignored miseries and sufferings

To forget my pain and Marie,
I already feel boredom in Death,
And I have lost faith in other worlds.. ""

In his great big hobnail boots
He's got such a job to pull them up
That he calls 'em daisy roots

And some of them forget

""What game do you think you're playing?""
She cried right from the 'eart
""You've missed me, am I too late?""

Oi! My old man's a dustman
He wears a dustman's hat
He wears cor-blimey trousers
And he lives in a council flat

Lonnie: I say, I say, I say!
Les: Not you again!
Lonnie: My dustbin's absolutely full with toadstools.
Les: How do you know it's full?
Lonnie: 'Cause there's not mushroom inside.

He found a tiger's head one day
Nailed to a piece of wood
The tiger looked like miserable
But I suppose he should

Just then from out a window
A voice began to wail
It said ""Oi! Where's me tiger's head?""
""Four foot from his tail.""

Oh my old man's a dustman
He wears a dustman's hat
He wears cor-blimey trousers
And he lives in a council flat

Next time you see a dustman
Looking all pale and sad
Don't kick him in the dustbin
It might be my old dad"

Margaret, array the rocks around the hole before we're sinking

And painting rings around your eyes, these peppered holes so filled with crying
A whisper-weight upon the tattered down where you and I were lying
Tell me now, O tell me this—a forest's son, a river's daughter
A willow wand, a will-o-wisp, our ghosts will wander all of the water

William & Margaret:
So let's be married here today, these rushing waves to bear our witness
And we will lie like river stones, rolling only where it takes us

But I pulled you and I called you here (Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I)
And I caught you and I brought you here (Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I)
But these hazards of love never more will trouble us

William:
O Margaret, the lapping waves are licking quietly at our ankles
Another bow, another breath—this brilliant chill has come for to shackle

William & Margaret:
But with this long, last rush of air let's speak our vows in starry whisper
And when the waves came crashing down, he closed his eyes and softly kissed her

(Singing,) But I pulled you and I called you here (Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I)

And when it's time I'll go and wait
Beside a legendary fountain
Till I see your form reflected
In its clear and jeweled waters
And if you think I'm ready
You may lead me to the chasm
Where the rivers of our vision
Flow into one another

I will watch her dive beneath
The white cascading waters
She may beg she may plead
She may argue with her logic
And mention all the things I'll lose

With a basket full of chicken and a big cold jug of sweet tea.

I make a little room and she climbs on up
Open up her throttle and stir a little dust
Just look at her face, she ain't foolin' me

She thinks my tractor's sexy
It really turns her on
She's always starin' at me
While I'm chuggin' along
She likes the way it's pullin' while we're tillin' up the land
She's even kinda crazy 'bout my farmer's tan
She's the only one who really understands what gets me
She thinks my tractor's sexy

We'll ride back and forth till we run outta light
Take it to the barn, put it up for the night
Climb up in the loft, sit and talk with the radio on
She says she got a dream and I ask what it is
She wants a little farm and a yard full of kids
And one more teeny weeny ride before I take her home

She thinks my tractor's sexy
It really turns her on
She's always starin' at me
While I'm chuggin' along
She likes the way it pullin' while we're tillin' up the land
She's even kinda crazy 'bout my farmers tan
She's the only one who really understands what gets me
She thinks my tractors sexy

Well she ain't into cars or pick up trucks
But if it runs likes a Deere, man, her eyes light up

She thinks my tractor
She thinks my tractor's sexy
It really turns her on
She's always starin' at me
While I'm chuggin' along
She likes the way it's pullin' while we're tillin' up the land
She's even kinda crazy 'bout my farmer's tan
She's the only one who really understands what gets me
She thinks my tractor's sexy

So eat what you murder
This is animal liberation

Who have lost our hair
Retained, some of our teeth
And gained a choice
We'll chase food, money and sex
Until satisfied
Then, when it's time to rest
Ask 'what's next?'

We are all animals (x4)

It's hard enough to retain control
When our instincts are egging us on
With biologists and chemists
Reducing our souls
To four letters
And when we think about it
We're like a masterpiece
Who's glimpsed the artist

We are the machines
Carrying on various genes
Then discarded
When the job is done
We are the disciples
Who have lost our way
Kicked from our pedestal
When Darwin burnt the book

Its hard enough to retain control
When our instincts are egging us on
With biologists and chemists
Reducing our souls
To four letters
When genes replace Genesis
We're like a masterpiece
Who's glimpsed the artist

We liked to think we had a special place
As if stars revolved around the human race
But we're just mammals, just primates
Like chimps or g'rillaz
We see the hair on our face
And look at another primate

What was her destiny?
Maybe I should lick her with my nine millime... ter
My mind is in a blur
Cause you could never pay me to think this would occur
Me and this girl Jane Doe was living together
We were inseparable, no one could sever
At least that's what I thought
But later I fought with her substance
And almost ended up in Supreme Court
When I was on the road doing shows getting bens
She was in my Benz getting sniffy with her friends
And even when she crashed my whip I didn't flip
My man Slick Nick said Smooth you're starting to slip
Time went on I started noticing weight loss
Then I had to ask her was she riding the white horse
At first she said no, then she said yo Smooth I'm sorry
But I keep having visions of snow
I need blow
And I said whoa little hottie
I'm not DeLorian, Gambino or Gotti
I don't deal coke, and furthermore you're making me broke
I'll put you in a rehab and I won't tell your folks

I caught you lying to yourself
Now everything is speeding 'round and around

How strong, how brave, how true of you
To bear the hurt I gave.
I know it tears your heart in two:
All I've said, all I say to you.

After all the words are said,
After all the dreams we made;
Every one a precious one,
Every one a summer sun...

A moment lost, forever gone,
Can never be again,
So know how much it means to me;
All you said,
All you gave,
All your love to me."

My mother said to me
""Son, it's not how many Germans you kill that counts
It's how many people you set free!""

So I packed my bags
Brushed my cap
Walked out into the world
Seventeen years old
Never kissed a girl

Took the train to Voronezh
That was as far as it would go
Changed my sacks for a uniform
Bit my lip against the snow
I prayed for mother Russia
In the summer of '43
And as we drove the Germans back
I really believed
That God was listening to me

We howled into Berlin
Tore the smoking buildings down
Raised the red flag high
Burnt the reichstag brown
I saw my first American
And he looked a lot like me
He had the same kinda farmer's face
Said he'd come from some place called Hazzard, Tennessee

Then the war was over
My discharge papers came
Me and twenty hundred others
Went to Stettiner for the train
Kiev! said the commissar
From there your own way home
But I never got to Kiev
We never came by home
Train went north to the Taiga
We were stripped and marched in file
Up the great siberian road
For miles and miles and miles and miles
Dressed in stripes and tatters
In a gulag left to die
All because Comrade Stalin was scared that
We'd become too westernized!

Used to love my country
Used to be so young
Used to believe that life was
The best song ever sung
I would have died for my country
In 1945

But now only one thing remains
But now only one thing remains
But now only one thing remains

Cast your hooks, I hope you catch
A glimpse of blinded bliss

Everything's crossed my mind
So don't you blink, I'm trying to think
Well everything could unwind
Well you move me, you used to use me
Now it's time to stand this ground
And if I don't come back, nothing will collapse
Nothing really ever comes around

Religion has raped us
Forever we rehearse the song
That strips our throats to blood
We bare our souls in transparency
But our velvet tongues will never please their ears
But are you holding on?
I'm holding on
Look at us dying
A field of human crucifixes, weathered and fading
Heaven hears nothing as the priests are wailing
And they're crushing our souls
We feel our lives
Sifting through our hands
But we're holding on
Look at my face
Look at God in my eyes
We stand"

I can only speak for
The things that I've been through
So when it comes to our love
I'll talk the whole night through
About the lovin' I've been missin'
Lately, baby I ain't had no kissin'
Don't you love me
Can we stay together

Like when we used to be in love
But now you've got your head on another cloud
Girl, we had a good thing
But now you've turned around
Don't you even care how this love
We've had turns out

(Promise me, you'll leave me never)
(That we'll be in love forever)
(Promise me, you'll leave me never)
(And that we'll be in love forever)

We can work at our love
And make it all brand-new
If we stay together
There's nothing we can't do
Improve the lovin' is what I'm seeing
Let's do it baby
Don't fight the feeling
Won't you love me
Can we stay together

Felicidade sim
A felicidade é como a pluma
Que o vento vai levando pelo ar
Voa tão leve
Mas tem a vida breve
Precisa que haja vento sem parar
A felicidade do pobre parece
A grande ilusão do carnaval
A gente trabalha
O ano inteiro
Por um momento de sonho
Pra fazer a fantasia
De rei ou de pirata ou jardineira
Pra tudo se acabar na quarta-feira

A felicidade é como a gota
De orvalho numa pétala de flor
Brilha tranqüila
Depois de leve oscila
E cai como uma lágrima de amor.

A minha felicidade está sonhando
Nos olhos da minha namorada
É como esta noite
Passando, passando
Em busca da madrugada
Falem baixo por favor
Pra que ela acorde alegre como o dia
Oferecendo beijos de amor."

Lurking in the core of us all 
The last dying call for the everlost 
Brief encounters, bleeding pain 

Lepers coiled neath the trees 
Dying men in bewildered soliloquies 
Perversions bloom round the bend 
Seekers, lost in their quest 
Ghosts of friends frolic 
Under the waning moon 

It is the year of death 
Wielding his instruments 
Stealth sovereign reaper 
Touching us with ease 

Infecting the roots in an instant 
Burning crop of disease 
I am just a spectator 
An advocate documenting the loss 
Fluttering with conceit 
This doesn't concern me yet 
Still far from the knell 
Taunting their bereavement 

Mob round the dead 
Point fingers at the details 
Probing vomits for more 
Caught in unbridled suspense

We have all lost it now 
Catching the flakes of dismay 
Born the travesty of man 
Regular pulse midst pandemonium 
You're plucked to the mass 
Parched with thirst for the wicked 

Sick liaisons raised this monumental mark 
The sun sets forever over Blackwater park"

Searching for the keys

Sorcery beyond the witches' spell
Robbed the crypts of Death's eternity
Killed the priest and cursed him endlessly

Chants of evil incantation
Fill the murky night
Free the Devil's knights of Hell
Unleash their growing spite

Directing power forcibly
The fire of Hell is cast
Resurrect from crypts of Death
A demon from the past

I have seen the darkened depths of Hell
Sorcery beyond the witches' spell
Robbed the crypts of Death's eternity
Killed the priest and cursed him endlessly

Cringe with fear
Violate the unbroken seal of Hell
Death will come searching for
Your mere soul
Still you are eager to seek your fate
All that lie here are remains of Death

Grinding bones, screaming skulls
Broken by the lapse of time
Decay to powder, ashes to dust
Diminishing, disintegrating

And a voice and a dream and a soul on fire

Where do you go - I get no answer
You're always out - it gets on my nerves

I don't know why sometimes I get frightened
You can see my eyes, you can tell that I'm not lying
But I don't know why sometimes I get frightened
You can see my eyes, can you tell me you're not lyin'
I don't know why sometimes I get frightened
You can see my eyes, you can tell that I'm not lying"

Forgive me pretty baby but I always take the long way home

Money's just something you throw
Off the back of a train
Got a handful of lightning
A hat full of rain
And I know that I said
I'd never do it again
Oh and I love you sweet baby but I always take the long way home

I put food on the table
And roof overhead
But I'd trade it all tomorrow
For The highway instead
Watch your back if I should tell you
Loves the only thing I've ever known
One thing for sure sweet baby I always take the long way home

You know I love you baby
More than the whole wide
I'm your woman
I know you are my pearl
Let's go out past the party lights
Where we can finally be alone
Come with me and we can take the long way home
Come with me, together we can take the long way home
Come with me, together we can take the long way home"

Sometimes it comes without warning
It turns me over inside

They have the authority to kill a minority

Fuck that shit 'cause I ain't the one
For a punk motherfucka with a badge and a gun
To be beaten on and thrown in jail
We can go toe to toe in the middle of a cell

With a little bit of gold and a pager
Searchin' my car, lookin' for the product

I'm a sniper with a hell of a scope
Takin' out a cop or two they can't cope with me

When the arrows start descending

Sits a map of passageways
Best to stumble upon Mt. Zion
To behold the natural gates

Never felt a drop of pain
Until that second in the garden
Then they felt it each and every day

So draw back your bows, you hunters
Who have never felt that pain

To wear around our necks

Or he'll grow to be an angry young man some day
Take a look at you and me
Are we too blind to see
Do we simply turn our heads
And look the other way

Well the world turns
And a hungry little boy with a runny nose
Plays in the street as the cold wind blows
In the ghetto

And his hunger burns
So he starts to roam the streets at night
And he learns how to steal
And he learns how to fight
In the ghetto

Then one night in desperation
The young man breaks the rules
He buys a gun, steals a car
Tries to run, but he don't get far
And his mama cries

As a crowd gathers 'round an angry young man
Face down on the street with a gun in his hand
In the ghetto

As her young man dies
On a cold and gray Chicago mornin'
Another little baby child is born
In the ghetto
And his mama cries"

Quando verrà al tuo cielo
Là dove in pieno giorno
Risplendono le stelle.

Quando attraverserà
L'ultimo vecchio ponte
Ai suicidi dirà
Baciandoli alla fronte
Venite in Paradiso
Là dove vado anch'io
Perché non c'è l'inferno
Nel mondo del buon Dio.

Fate che giunga a Voi
Con le sue ossa stanche
Seguito da migliaia
Di quelle facce bianche
Fate che a voi ritorni
Fra i morti per oltraggio
Che al cielo ed alla terra
Mostrarono il coraggio.

Signori benpensanti
Spero non vi dispiaccia
Se in cielo, in mezzo ai Santi
Dio, fra le sue braccia
Soffocherà il singhiozzo
Di quelle labbra smorte
Che all'odio e all'ignoranza
Preferirono la morte.

Dio di misericordia
Il tuo bel Paradiso
Lo hai fatto soprattutto
Per chi non ha sorriso
Per quelli che han vissuto
Con la coscienza pura
L'inferno esiste solo
Per chi ne ha paura.

Meglio di lui nessuno
Mai ti potrà indicare
Gli errori di noi tutti
Che puoi e vuoi salvare
Ascolta la sua voce
Che ormai canta nel vento

Vedrai, sarai contento.

Why do you make up all these stories 
Made up your mind, decided for me 

I can tell by the way you walk you wanna be alone with him 

When you called me on the telephone I knew that you were miles away 
'Cause the words that you said to me weren't hiding what you couldn't say

I can tell by the way you talk you wanna be alone with him (alone with him)

He was in my dreams 
What else could it mean 

When you laugh at me behind my back I'll turn and you can run away 
Will you tell him all the special things you told me you could never say 

I never said I'd be yours only, I didn't know until you told me 
If I go I won't be lonely, if I stay now you don't own me 

I can tell by the way you smile your love is changing on a whim 

Maybe I will and maybe I won't
Maybe I do and maybe I don't
Maybe I will and maybe I won't

You seem like you've always been,

Wrote a book that's already been read,



And if there was a beast would you hold him?

And be a doctor by his side?

He'll take the drugs that you've stolen,

You'll be drunk on electric wine.

Oh this town you've never seen before,

There's always big guns at your door,

The sentiment of class is blood born,



I'd like to write a song for you,

With arms wide open the way I do,

And I'd like to tell the truth to you,

Shot through the chest the way I do.

Talk to each other become close
In a town much like a prison cell

People speak our names
On the street in hushed tones
Oh the stories they'd tell
If anyone would listen

You come from a town where
People don't bother saying hello
Unless somebody's born or dies

And I come from a place where they
Drag your hopes through the mud
Because their own dreams are all dying

And when we walk down the street
The wind sings our name in rebel songs
The sounds of the night should make us anxious
But it's much too late when the fear is gone

I will meet you in the Next Life, I promise you
Where we can be together, I promise you
I will wait till then in Heaven, I promise you
I promise, I promise

There's so many fighting
To get past the Pearly Gates
But nobody ever wants to die or get saved

Their intentions aren't that good
And I can smell the asphalt
That's their personal road to hell being paved

And when we walk down the street
The wind sings our name in rebel songs
But it's much too late when the fear is gone

I will meet you in the Next Life, I promise you
Where we can be together, I promise you

And the grass is several shades of blue

It takes all these things and all that time
Till my sugar spun sister's happy
With this love of mine
It'll take all these things and oh much more

I've paid for fifteen or more
But my guts can't take many more
My hands are stuck to my jeans
And she knows, she knows what this must mean

She wakes up with the sun
She asked me what is all the fuss
As she gave me more than she thought she should
She wakes up with the sun
I think what have I done
As I gave her more than I thought I would, oh

Flame from mouth, smoke he breathes
Enter the caverns of the deep

It can be a lonely place

Up ahead there lies your road
And your conscience walks beside you

It bears witness to your soul
Make sure that the love you offer up
Does not fall on barren soil
For the wind cries of late
In the whispering grass
Our way of life is held
In the spinning wheels of chance
I believe in a way of long ago
And the sounds I believe rose our glow
And we're changing our ways
Yes, we are taking on different roads
Tell me more about the forest
That you once called home
For the wind cries of late
In the whispering leaves
And the sun will turn to waste
The heavens we build above
Father, teach your children
To treat our mother well
If we give her back her diamonds
She will offer up her pearl
We must sing her creation song
Jeune du monde
Invoke the spirits that feed us
This dreaming takes too long
But I'm not bitter, no, I'm surviving
To face the world, to raise the future
So why don't you tell me, come on and tell me
About the world you left behind
Can you tell me?"

Through the justice of suffering

When the paying of her sins come closer
The night will end in tears
And the moment you dirt her skin with your fingers
You will be sentenced the same
Every second with her I count
And for every second you will suffer too

No light will save them now
When the words of hope have all been spoken
And I wash the blood from my hands
And let them lie silent and cold on the flowers

For my anger is greater
Than the hand that once swept your cheek
And my anger is greater
Than the human I was
I will claim that is mine
Through the justice of suffering

No light will save them now
When the words of hope have all been spoken
And I wash the blood from my hands
And let them lie silent and cold on the flowers

Is this poison in your womb
Worth of the burning flesh
In this pyre of ghost lovers

And for every second you will suffer too
The night will end...
It will end in tears soon"

Looks beyond the credits sum
Livid fractures less of fate
The whisper winds blow the seeds of hate

Disturbed society
Dogs might turn with no values
Intend to raise ability
A tried and tested pointless view
God's got security
Hands like snakes sow the seeds

Raise all negative force-fed
Traces poisons all impure
Profane the haunted heaven
Jeering leapt into the pit of calamity
A mean condition no wealth dents
Provisions for a time unknown
Thelemic gestures are planned and hatched
In seasons of dissolute pain

I cried afflicted and infected
Oblige the system's perfect dream
Distorted my words
Assume all that is programmed before me
And somewhat left unsaid behind shutters

Dirt before desire
Dusted crap ingested comes
Stealing life that you are not visited
Warped torpedo night crawls through
The distant and irrelevant
A good life's experiment fused

I'm laying violent hands upon
A dead card calling cattle
The playthings are so abused
The derelict dial phone clock pusher
Delved in reliving the future too

I'm sticking pins and needles
In this stinging rotten flesh-like substitute
Pieces of half cooked meat that are
Walking on this earth
Abort desire irrelevance ticks in front in view
Ticks in front of you
Ticks in front in view

Burnt out shadows on the wall seize the moment

And I'll take comfort in that someday I shall die

I've said and I've done things in my time and make you shiver
I've spent time with wistful eyes just staring at the river
In the end I couldn't even find the words she wanted me to say
In her heart she knows she never knew me anyway
What can I say

I will laugh and I will cry
And I'll take comfort in that someday I shall die

I will laugh and I will cry
And I'll take comfort in that someday I shall die

Take for instance if you will a person you don't care for
Not someone you hate, just someone you turn off the phone for
Spare a thought for them because no matter how much they whine and they moan
There's not a bad thing you can say about them they've not said when they're alone
Pick up the phone

I will laugh and I will cry
And I'll take comfort in that someday I shall die

Casting shivering shadows on the houses through the trees
And the light from a street lamp paints a pattern on my wall
Like the pieces of a puzzle or a child's uneven scrawl

Up a narrow flight of stairs in a narrow little room
As I lie upon my bed in the early evening gloom
Impaled on my wall, my eyes can dimly see
The pattern of my life and the puzzle that is me

From the moment of my birth to the instant of my death
There are patterns I must follow just as I must breathe each breath
Like a rat in a maze, the path before me lies
And the pattern never alters until the rat dies

And the pattern still remains on the wall where darkness fell
And it's fitting that it should for in darkness I must dwell
Like the color of my skin or the day that I grow old
My life is made of patterns that can scarcely be controlled"

And the mad, moaning winds
At night the deserts writhed
With diabolical things

Through the night, through the night
The wind lashed and it whipped me

Was no longer with me

Somewhere she lies, this lovely creature
Beneath the slow drifting sands
With her hair full of ribbons
And green gloves on her hands"

(RZA) Sparkin your braincells to the upmost
(Tekitha) Impossible
(RZA) Unlimited epidemics bein spread
(Tekitha) You can never defeat
(RZA) You know, we try and add on for y'all niggas
(Tekitha) The Gods
(RZA) Yo, yo

Verse One: RZA

Fusion of the five elements, to search for the higher intelligence
Women walk around celibate, livin' irrelevant
The most benelovent king, communicatin through your dreams
Mental pictures been painted, Allah's heard and seen
Everywhere, throughout your surroundin atmosphere
Troposphere, thermosphere, stratosphere
Can you imagine from one single idea, everything appeared here
Understanding makes my truth, crystal clear
Innocent black immigrants locked in housing tenemants
Eighty-Five percent tenants depend on welfare recipients
Stapleton's been stamped as a concentration camp
At night I walk through, third eye is bright as a street lamp
Electric microbes, robotic probes
Taking telescope pictures of globe, babies getting pierced with microchips
Stuffed inside their earlobes, then examined
Blood contaminated, vaccinated, lives fabricated
Exaggerated authorization, Food and Drug Administration
Testin poison in prison population
My occupation to stop the innauguration of Satan
Some claim that it was Reagan, so I come to slay men
Like Bartholemew, cause every particle is physical article
Was diabolical to the last visible molecule
A space night like Rom, consume planets like Unicron
Blasting photon bombs from the arm like Galvatron

Verse Two: U-God

United Nations, gun fire style patient
Formulatin rap plural acapella occupation
Conquer land like Napoleon, military bomb fest
We want sanitary food, planetary conquest
Thug peoples on some hardco' body shit
Get your shit together 'fore the fuck Illuminati hit
Dreams is free in escape of sleep
For a fool peep jewels, keep tools for tough time
The rule of rough mind, elevate, stay behind
The sun gotta shine, keep on, cremate
The whole Babylon, times up, move on
Kings on your pawn, checkmate, no fakes
Opposed through the gate, case closed
Things get froze, when it comes time, chosen ones
Were holding guns, we take flight with no fright
And attack, never fear cause our words is clear
What's been done can't be undone Son, we can't care
Cause the last days and times are surely here
Snakes and flakes get blown, by the rightous ones
Divine minds bind, we unified as one
Half of black hope, we half broke, smoke a bowl of weed shit
Our everlastin answers stay flyin over Egypt

Chorus: Tekitha

For you to defeat, the Gods
Impossible, you can never... defeat
The Gods, impossible
For you to defeat, the Gods

Verse Three: Ghostface Killah

Call an ambulance, Jamie been shot, word to Kemit
Don't go Son, nigga you my motherfuckin heart
Stay still Son, don't move, just think about Keeba
She'll be three in January, your young God needs you
The ambulance is taking too long
Everybody get the fuck back, excuse me bitch, gimme your jack
One, seven one eight, nine one one, low battery, damn
Blood comin' out his mouth, he bleedin badly
Nah Jamie, don't start that shit
Keep your head up, if you escape hell we gettin' fucked up
When we was eight, we went to Bat Day to see the Yanks
In Sixty-Nine, his father and mines, they robbed banks
He pointed to the charm on his neck
With his last bit of energy left, told me rock it with respect
I opened it, seen the God holdin' his kids
Photogenic, tears just burst out my wig
Plus he dropped one, oh shit, here come his Old Earth
With no shoes on, screamin holdin' her breasts with a gown on
She fell and then lightly touched his jaw, kissed him
Rubbed his hair, turned around the ambulance was there
Plus the blue coats, Officer Lough, took it as a joke
Weeks ago he strip-searched the God and gave him back his coke
Bitches yellin', Beenie Man swung on Helen
In the back of a cop car, dirty tarts are tellin'
But suddenly a chill came through it was weird
Felt like my man, was cast out my heaven now we share
Laid on the stretcher, blood on his Wally's like ketchup
Deep like the full assassination with a sketch of it
It can't be, from Yohoo to Lee's
Second grade humped the teachers, about to leave
Finally this closed chapter, comes to an end
He was announced, pronounced dead, y'all, at twelve ten

Outro: Raekwon and Tekitha

Now what my man is trying to tell y'all
Is that across the whole globe (you can never)
The murder rates is increasin, and we decreasin (you can never)
So at the same time, when you play with guns
When you play with guns Son (you can never defeat)
That causes the conflict of you goin' against your own (the Gods)
You hear me, so let's pay attention
Straight up and down, cause this is only a story

The glow of the off switch
It's so good to hear your voice
As a stolen guitar falls

I don't think before I speak
I break you're heart

Just waiting for your turn to speak
Everyone's got an opinion
I stair and nod my head
And leave straight when it finishes

I think I could do better
So arrogant

You read and it makes no sense
Don't understand a single word he says
My head hurts from being on the phone
And my ears are ringing from the night before

I don't think before I speak
I break you're heart
I think I could do better

Pray for the cleansing
Pray for the flood
Pray for the end of this nightmare

We seek only reprieve and welcome the darkness
The myth of a meaning so lost and forgotten (forgotten)

Take hold of my hand
For you are no longer alone
Walk with me in Hell

Pray for solace
Pray for resolve
Pray for a savior
Pray for deliverance, some kind of purpose
A glimpse of a light in this void of existence

Now witness the end of an age
Hope dies in hands of believers
Who seek the truth in the liar's eye

Take hold of my hand
For you are no longer alone
Walk with me in Hell

Walk with me in Hell
Walk with me in Hell
Walk with me in Hell
Walk with me in Hell

And all the love was never true
The more that we refused to fight
It seemed that I was never right
Walking another sleepless dream
And now everything I leave behind
I leave for you

Look into the mirror, what am I?
A frightened creature locked inside
My mother's hair, my father's eyes
Memories, time rearranged for you
Is everything changed for you?
Do they make it better?

But practically everything leaves me totally cold
The only exception I know is the case
When I'm out on a quiet spree, fighting vainly the old ennui
And I suddenly turn and see
Your fabulous face

I get no kick from champagne
Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all
So tell me why should it be true
That I get a kick out of you

Some get a kick from cocaine
I'm sure that if I took even one sniff
That would bore me terrifically too
But I get a kick out of you
I get a kick every time I see you standing there before me
I get a kick though it's clear to me, you obviously don't adore me
I get no kick in a plane
Flying too high with some guy in the sky
Is my idea of nothing to do
Yet I get a kick out of you"

We all said ""fuck you bitch!"" and kept goin'

Was to kill a man

Beat it out, out of me, cut me up and watch me bleed
Strike me down, cast me out
Throw me into the ocean's mouth
My only prayer
Was to a God
Who I don't believe
But all the same, I'm on my knees
Beat it out, out of me, cut me up and watch me bleed
Strike me down, cast me out
Throw me into the Devil's mouth

Bleeding, weeping, calling to no one
Pleading, alimghty, why can't you hear me

My only sin
Was to kill a man
Deep was my pain
But I'd do the sam again
Beat it out, out of me, cut me up and watch me bleed
Strike me down, cast me out
Throw me into my own mouth

I'm losing myself

No reason am I for

I can't divide or hide from me
I don't know who I'm meant to be
I guess it's just the person that I am

Often I've dreamt that I don't wait
Enjoy the gift of my mistake

You and your family can have peace and tranquility.
Enjoy the refinement..""
""Hey Bone, hey nigga where you at though?""
""Hello, my name is Elaine --
And I'll be your tour guide through South Central Los Angeles""

How to survive in South Central (what you do?)
A place where bustin' a cap is fundamental
No, you can't find the shit in a handbook
Take a close look, at a rap crook
Rule number one: get yourself a gun
A nine in your ass'll be fine
Keep it in your glove compartment
'Cause jackers (yo) they love to start shit
Now if you're white you can trust the police
But if you're black they ain't nothin' but beasts
Watch out for the kill
Don't make a false move and keep your hands on the steering wheel
And don't get smart
Answer all questions, and that's your first lesson
On stayin' alive
In South Central, yeah, that's how you survive
""Hi this is Elaine again.
Are you enjoying your stay in South Central Los Angeles,
Or is somebody taking your things? Have you witnessed a drive-by?
Okay, make sure you have your camcorder ready
To witness the extracurricular activities on blacks by the police,
So you and your family can enjoy this tape, over and over again.""
""This is Los Angeles."" ""This is Los Angeles.""

Rule number two: don't trust nobody
Especially a bitch, with a hooker's body
'Cause it ain't nuttin' but a trap
And females'll get jacked and kidnapped
You'll wind up dead
Just to be safe don't wear no blue or red
'Cause most niggaz get got
In either L.A., Compton or Watts
Pissed-off black human beings
So I think you better skip the sight-seeing
And if you're nuttin but a mark
Make sure that you're in before dark
But if you need some affection mate
Make sure the bitch ain't a section eight
'Cause if so that's a monkey-wrench hoe
And you won't survive in South Central
""Now you realize it's not all that it's cracked up to be.
You realize that it's fucked up!
It ain't nothin' like the shit you saw on TV
Palm trees and blonde bitches?
I'd advise to you to pack your shit and get the fuck on;
Punk motherfucker!""
And you need your ass straight smoked
Yo I wanna say whassup to DJ Chilly Chill
Sir Jinx, aiyyo Cube these motherfuckers don't know what time it is
So show these motherfuckers what's happenin'
Tell these motherfuckers, don't fuck around in South Central
God damnit!

Rule number three: don't get caught up
'Cause niggaz are doing anything that's thought up
And they got a vice
On everything from dope, to stolen merchandise
We discern
'Cause South Central L.A., is one big yearn
Waitin' for a brother like you to catch a disease
And start slangin' ki's
To an undercover or the wrong brother
And they'll smother, a out of town motherfucker
So don't take your life for granted
'Cause it's the craziest place on the planet
In L.A. heroes don't fly through the sky of stars
They live behind bars
So everybody's doin' a little dirt
And it's the youngsters puttin' in the most work
So be alert and stay calm
As you enter, the concrete Vietnam
You say, the strong survive
Shit, the strong even die, in South Central
Yeah you bitches, you think I forgot about your ass,
You tramp-ass hoes? You better watch out.
And for you so called baller-ass niggaz,
You know what time it is. South Central ain't no joke.
Got to keep your gat at all times motherfuckers.
Better keep one in the chamber and nine in the clip god damnit.
You'll sho' get got, just like that.
This ain't no joke motherfuckers.
Now I wanna send a shout-out to E-Dog, the engineer,
Puttin' his two cents in...

The world is creeping in
Another lonely day with it standing on my way
The twinkle in your eye
Appears to me in light
Would you take my hand
And lead me through without a fight

Nowhere to go nowhere to feel at home
Another lonely day

Bizzy Bone:
20 dollar hollars, all day, everyday
Come around my way, we gone want to stay
Weed makes me hungry, happy, and all I can say
Sure I need some more
Don't make me wait, stay awake, fake sleep
Got the weed between the sheets
Catch me
Mary Jane bless me
Open up the dime, stimulate your mind, slide my thumb up the blunt
Open up to what you find in mari... juana
I've never been in high times (lovin' them high times)
I never been in high times (but could you tell me)
Am I high enough (am I high enough)
Am I high enough (am I high enough)

Wish Bone:
I remember being a little thug
Weed, really didn't know what it was
Then I took a puff and I realized
I should always stay high

The weed, the weed, makes me feel, all right (all right)
If you feel like I feel, I got half on your dime
If you got weed smoke it, I'm a real weed smoker
If it's mine then I would, since it's yours you could, you should

If I ain't there when you blaze a blunt nigga huh, please think of me
'Cause you know a nigga love to get high, high, high and free
Smokin' all night, feelin' all right, Bone Thugs get high, so high
High, high, all night, high, high, so high

Flesh-N-Bone:
Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my my my my
I know you wonder why I do this love the sky
And I soar up so high
This mornin' I was in my bed
Bangin' and ringin' inside my head
I wanted to make love to you baby, but last night I got P-O-Ded instead
So baby don't go away, all I got to say
Is I gotta have you Mary J
Such a heavenly feelin' I get when I'm taking fat ass blunts to the brain
Oh darlin' I'm going insane and I wish we really can
Kick it at home in America, like it was on in Amsterdam
You heard that I'm, you heard I'm, nothin' but a, realer thug nigga
Nothin' less than a killa, I might if I'm makin' a scrilla
I never knew no one as live as the bone that kick as strong as me
Be rippin' the bong like me, can hit it as long as me

Layzie Bone:
When I need to free my mind
I can find, satisfaction in a bag of weed
Everything I need, leave it to the trees
It can make me feel better, and everyday I wake we
Be rollin' up blunts, and mo' blunts, and mo' blunts
And I, keep a case of swissha sweets in the trunk
So when I'm rollin', smokin', chokin', just floatin'
Through the city in the drop top
Glock cocked, rollin', just rollin'
Me and Mary Jane
That's my world, that's my thang
The way she penetrates my brain
Buddha, done blessed me with game
Good game, you wanna chop it up, we can kick it, smoke a phatty to the dome
Nigga lay high, thugged out, smokin', all, night, long

Borrowed house for a borrowed crime.
In need of help I came to your door.
Saw the spike of the railings from
The 28/3rd floor.
Singing
""Build your castle, stop collecting stones
And the river bed shall not be yoru home""

To the lighthouse my friend!
I bless your words and education
To the lighthouse my friend.
Just go! just go!
To the lighthouse my friend.
I am sorry that you came to find


""Great great minds
Against themselves conspire'

Now the bombs drop around our feet,
Do we throw them back
Or bow and greet them.
Everyone now, is so terrified
Of the glowing dark
And those orange skies.

Sing it:
'Build your castle, stop throwing stones
'Cause those fire birds are
Coming down on our homes""

To the lighthouse my friends
We must go, we must go"

Welcome to your nightmare
You just can't walk away
It's time for you, to choose, your fate
You just can't let it lay
Welcome to your nightmare
Your whole life's on the way,
Today

You're no good, misunderstood, A.I.R.
All their hopes and visions, of what they want you to be
Crucial times, made up minds, A.I.R.
So high and mighty, though much too blind to see

Who are you gonna live your life for?
Conformity will trap you like a locked door
Independence means owning your decisions
Authority will put your soul in prison

Fight, or go insane, there's no one else to blame
Stop, their influence, you can't give them a chance
Break, right through the wall, that separates us all
Start, your second life, without their hands in sight

You got your pride, you got your visions
Don't subside, don't ever give in
Don't compromise just keep on grinning
The games they play you just keep on winning
Keep on winning
Keep on winning
Keep on winning

See how happy she has made me
I will take this road much further
Though I know not where it takes me

I have water for my journey
I have bread and I have wine
No longer will I be hungry
For the bread of life is mine

I saw a navy blue bird
Flying way above the sea
I walked on and I learned later
That this navy blue bird was me

I returned a paler blue bird
And this is the advice they gave me
""You must not try to be too pure
You must fly closer to the sea""

Think I'll join a rock and roll band
I'll camp out on the land
I'll try and set my soul free

We are stardust, we are golden
And we've got to get ourselves back to the garden

Well, then can I walk beside you?
I have come here to lose the smog
And I feel just like a cog 
In something turning
Well maybe it's the time of year
Or maybe it's the time of man
And I don't know who I am
But life's for learning

We are stardust, we are golden
And we've got to get ourselves back to the garden

By the time I got to Woodstock
They were half a million strong
Everywhere there were songs and celebration
And I dreamed I saw the bombers
Riding shotgun in the sky
Turning into butterflies above our nation

We are stardust, we are golden
And we've got to get ourselves back to the garden

It's far beyond the stars
It's near beyond the moon
I know beyond a doubt
My heart will lead me there soon


We'll meet beyond the shore
We'll kiss just like before
Happy we will be beyond the sea
And never again I'll go sailing

I've played all my cards
And that's what you've done too
Nothing more to say
No more ace to play

The winner takes it all
The loser standing small
Beside the victory
That's her destiny

I was in your arms
Thinking I belonged there
I figured it made sense
Building me a fence

Building me a home
Thinking I'd be strong there
But I was a fool
Playing by the rules

The gods may throw the dice
Their minds as cold as ice
And someone way down here
Loses someone dear

The winner takes it all
The loser has to fall
It's simple, and it's plain
Why should I complain?

Tell me, does she kiss
Like I used to kiss you?
Does it feel the same
When she calls your name?

Somewhere deep inside
You must know I miss you
But what can I say?
Rules must be obeyed

The judges will decide
The likes of me abide
Spectators of the show
Always staying low

The game is on again
A lover or a friend
A big thing or a small
The winner takes it all

I don't wanna talk
'Cause it makes me feel sad
And I understand
You've come to shake my hand

I apologise
If it makes you feel bad
Seeing me so tense, no self confidence
But you see

The winner takes it all
The winner takes it all

A lover or a friend
A big thing or a small
The winner takes it all

And get into this groove
The room's starting to move
Now turn the red lights on
You know the kind that I like
Deep blues and reds
With purple highlights

But don't forget my Oohhs
And fade in my Ahhs

Fade out the parades
And the charades
Making music like love is made
And lovers wait patiently
And with joy
For the right moment
To explor in passion
Why everlasting love is everlasting

But don't forget my Oohhs
And fade in my Ahhs

Ther's no need to argue for better position
Realize the moment that you're in is magic
Stellare regions cry everything has its season
Everything happens for a reason
So who are we to worry at any rate
The plane that crashed
We missed 'cause we were running late
And if success eludes you
Then you must choose to do
What other people wouldn't do

But don't forget my Oohhs
And fade in my Ahhs

So as cold night fades into darkness
Harken to the fire
Where you may find some peace
As many people pass
Some good and some bad
But this fire glows stronger yet
And burning bright reminds us

To ever be reborn
The sun sets soon
Uprises the moon
The sun sets soon
Uprises the moon"

There's no one in the place
Accept you and me

So set 'em up, Joe
I've got a little story
You oughtta know

We're drinking, my friend
To the end of a brief episode
Make it one for my baby
And one more for the road

I've got the routine
So drop another nickel in the machine
I'm feeling so bad
I wish you'd make the music dreamy and sad

Could tell you a lot
But you've gotta to be true to your coat
Make it one for my baby
And one more for the road

You'd never know it
But buddy, I'm a kind of poet
And I've got a lot of things to say

And when I'm gloomy
You simply gotta listen to me
Until it's talked away

Well that's how it goes
And Joe, I know you're
Gettin' anxious to close

So thanks for the cheer
I hope you didn't mind
My bending your ear

But this torch that I found
Must be drowned
Or it soon may explode

Make it one for my baby
And one more for the road
That long, long road"

1416,ML1417,Red House Painters,Medicine Bottle,sad,"Giving in to love and sharing my time
Letting someone into my misery
I told it all step-by-step
How I landed on the island and how I'd swim across the sea
And it crosses my mind that I may awake to a knife in me

No more breath in my hair or ladies' underwear
Tossed up over the alarm clock
Blood dripping from the bed to a neatly written poem, a heartfelt last line reading:
""There is no more mystery"". Is it going to happen, my love?
""There is no more mystery"". Is it going to happen, my love?

""It's all in my head"", she said, ""Morning after nightmare
You're building a wall"", she said, ""Higher than the both of us
So try living life instead of hiding in the bedroom
Show me a smile and I'll promise not to leave you""

It happened under a rainy cloud, passing through the dark south
We went into a big house and slept in a small bed
I didn't know you then as well as you of me
We talked of our sad lives, and we went off separately
And we went off separately. I found your overseas souvenirs
Holiday greeting cards and some long-forgot high school fears

""It's all in my head"", I said, banging a piano
""I've not been so alone"", I thought, ""Since kicking in the womb""
I drank so much tea, I wrote my letters in Kanji, yeah
Around the block I walked and walked, pretending you were with me

Not wanting to die out here
Without you

The hurting never ends, like birthdays and old friends
We forget that this flesh, blood and bone is human
Trading phone lines for airlines. Unwilling to face
That love is found on the inside, not the outside
And like a medicine bottle in the cabinet I'll keep you
And like a medicine bottle in my hand I will hold you

And swallow you slowly, as to last me a lifetime
Without holding too tight; I do not want to lose
The thrill that it gives me to look out from my window
And scowl at the houses from my world in the bedroom

""It's all in his head,"" she read in a girlfriend's self-help book
""It's all his own making; a war with himself
Like two sides of a wall that separates two countries
He shuts out the world and wants only to love you""

Not wanting to die out here
Without you
Not wanting to die out here
Without you"

Just company to sleep

And then in dreams we meet
And stay asleep

Didn't know quite where I was
Though I felt far away and cold
It was so late but my mind was curious
It was quiet, snowing with frosted windows
I had a book but wasn't reading just watching you

Didn't want comforting
Just company, oh be sweet
It could go either way
Based on what they say

I didn't wish to be somewhere else

Go away and I'll think only of myself

And to think that you would not be scared or surprised if I'd severed all these ties
This is the end...

I'll lose myself in anguish for tonight
Help me get over you

I feel so numb to see this bitter end of beautiful illusions... would this be the same?
Broken pieces will not mend to save our past now... go away...

I'll lose myself in anguish for tonight
Help me get over you
One last false apology
Help me get over you

Made for the horizon
No sense of direction
I walked on for miles

I hide from the headlamps
No lights in the window
The whole town is sleeping and somewhere you lie
Oh, I wish I could find you
Oh I'm lost by the river

My face scarred by branches
I shiver with cold
No, I don't think I'll find you

Who scheme and run wild
Who speak with their wings
And the way that they smile
What are the secrets

And why do you tremble
Each time they ride by

Throw out your gold teeth
And see how they roll
The answer they reveal
Life is unreal

Who are these strangers
Who pass through the door
Who cover your action
And go you one more
If you're feeling lucky
You best not refuse
It's your game the rules
Are your own win or lose"

And to be shown a glimpse of the truth
Made my cheek flush and my mouth smile
My chest's like a cage full of butterflies
It tickled and I laught ""such a rare, rare joy""

Suddenly the balloon loosened itself, he said
""I have to move further on, I'll keep on flying
Keep on showing the truth from my point of view""

You ruined everything in the nicest way
Bumps in the road remind us
The worst of the best behind us
Only good things will find us, me and you
Days will be clear and sunny
We're gonna need more money

Despite my better efforts it's all for you

You ruined everything in the nicest way"

In a metal dragon locked in time,
Skimming waves of an underground sea
In some kind of a dream world fantasy

Sun a hot circle on a canopy,
'25 a racing blot on a bright green sea
Ahead the dim blur of an alien land,
Time to give ourselves to strange gods' hands

Dark flak spiders bursting in the sky,
Reaching twisted claws on every side
No place to run,
No place to hide,
No turning back on a suicide ride

Toy city streets crawling through my sights,
Sprouting clumps of mushrooms like a world surreal
This dream won't ever seem to end,
And time seems like it'll never begin

And a one way ride
30 seconds,
And no place to hide
30 seconds over Tokyo"

I can make it as severe as I can
Until you realize you'll never take a stand
It isn't just a one-sided version
We've dealt with a manic subversion
I won't let the truth be perverted
And I won't leave another victim deserted

We, we are the new diabolic
We, we are the bitter bucolic
If I have to give my life, you can have it
We, we are the pulse of the maggots

Do you understand? Yes
Do you understand? Yes
Do you understand? Yes
Do you understand? Yes

Say it again, say it again (We won't die)
Say it again, say it again (We won't die)
Say it again, say it again (We won't die)
Say it again, say it again (We won't die)

Say it again, say it again (We won't die)
Say it again, say it again (We won't die)
Say it again, say it again (We won't die)
Say it again, say it again (We won't die)

We fight till no one can fight us
We live and no one can stop us
We pull when we're pushed too far
And the advantage is, the bottom line is
We never had to fight in the first place
We only had to spit back in their face
We won't walk alone any longer
What doesn't kill us only makes us stronger

We, we are the new diabolic
We, we are the bitter bucolic
If I have to give my life, you can have it
We, we are the pulse of the maggots

Do you understand? Yes
Do you understand? Yes
Do you understand? Yes

Crippling the hardest pig nose shell

A little spark that would be kingsize
The mirror does no justice to your spell

You always keep me guessing
I never seem to know just what you are thinking
And if a girl looks at you
Yeah, for sure your little eye will be a-winking
I get confused, I never know where I stand
And then you smile and hold my hand

If you decide some day to stop this little game that you are playing
I'm gonna tell you all the things my heart's just been dying to be saying (straight up)

1493,ML1494,Leonard Cohen,Teachers,sad,"I met a woman long ago
Her hair the black that black can go,
Are you a teacher of the heart?
Soft she answered no.

I met a girl across the sea,
Her hair the gold that gold can be,
Are you a teacher of the heart?
Yes, but not for thee.

I met a man who lost his mind
In some lost place I had to find,
Follow me the wise man said,
But he walked behind.

I walked into a hospital
Where none was sick and none was well,
When at night the nurses left
I could not walk at all.

Morning came and then came noon,
Dinner time a scalpel blade
Lay beside my silver spoon.

Some girls wander by mistake
Into the mess that scalpels make.
Are you the teachers of my heart?
We teach old hearts to break.

One morning I woke up alone,
The hospital and the nurses gone.
Have I carved enough my Lord?
Child, you are a bone.

I ate and ate and ate,
No I did not miss a plate, well
How much do these suppers cost?
We'll take it out in hate.

I spent my hatred everyplace,
On every work on every face,
Someone gave me wishes
And I wished for an embrace.

Several girls embraced me, then
I was embraced by men,
Is my passion perfect?
No, do it once again.

I was handsome I was strong,
I knew the words of every song.
Did my singing please you?
No, the words you sang were wrong.

Who is it whom I address,
Who takes down what I confess?
Are you the teachers of my heart?
We teach old hearts to rest.

Oh teachers are my lessons done?
I cannot do another one.
They laughed and laughed and said: ""Well child,
Are your lessons done?
Are your lessons done?
Are your lessons done?"""

Orders fly like bullet stream
Drums and cannons laugh aloud
Whistles come from ashen shroud
Leaders damn the world and roar
But no man can find the war 

Is the war across the sea?
Is the war behind the sky?
Have you each and all gone blind:
Is the war inside your mind?

All the talkers lose their breath
Movies paint a chaos tale
Singers see and poets wail

We kissed again as the showers swept the Florida shore
You opened your umbrella

But we walked between the raindrops back to your door
We walked between the raindrops back to your door
Oh, Miami

In my dreams, I can hear the sound of thunder
I can see the causeway by the big hotels
That happy day, we'll find each other on that Florida shore
You'll open your umbrella

And we'll walk between the raindrops back to your door
We'll walk between the raindrops
Between the raindrops
Walk between the raindrops back to your door"

Jealousy's a bad invention
When you push on glass it's bound to break

Even when she was defensive
It just gave me more incentive
The more you squeeze, the more it slips away

On a lonely street
With no one there for me
Is it worth the pain
With no one to blame?
For all of my insecurities
How did I ever let you go?

You're not my possession
I'm walking on pins and needles
My conscience is vicious
I'm walking on pins and needles
And I'm begging forgiveness

Than you could be in all your life's long years
The lazy lip of sea, it calmly laps
Beneath the looming disco's tens of tears
Or sure their fondest love is for a fake
An obviously fake contrived ideal
In hotels high above the foaming lake
Above bone plates he'd tie with lamb and veal
And breathing smoke since folded into air
And waving bills since spent on kid's grand schools
Some fat cat calculated it right there
The thing they'd turn so selflessly such tools
The polished plate betrays a vacant host
But they're more prepared to deal with pain than most"

In the distance. I hear them devouring
Pest-ridden jackals of the earth
Diabolical beasts and roaming the forests
In wait and constant protectors
Calling you to sit by his side
Your self-loathing image in his flesh
A revelation upon which you linger

His words are flies
Swarming towards the true insects
Feasting on buried dreams
And spreading decay upon your skin
His eyes spew forth a darkness
That cut through and paralyze
Casts light upon your secrets
Forced to confront your enemies

His mouth is a vortex
Sucking you into its pandemonium
Fools you with a helping hand of ashes
Reached out in false dismay
His body is a country
The cities lay dead beyond despair
Friends turned enemies unable to come clean 
In a rising fog of reeking death

Everything you believed is a lie
Everyone you loved is a death-burden
So you take comfort in him
And you are receptive to stark wishes
No longer struggling to declare your stand
You would inflict no harm to others
They are unaware and in a loop of futile events
You are everything, they are nothing

Drown in the deep mire
With past desires
Beneath the mire
Drown desire now with you

Lined up verses on dead skin
The tainted lips of a stranger 
Resting upon hers

And I embrace bereavement
Everything beloved is shattered anyway
I would devote myself to anyone
I would accept any flaws

I am too weak to resist
Tension vibrating with horror
Finding the outcast in my eyes
Pushing nerves on a puppet
Endless poison in my veins
Clean intent now tainted with death

And so, cold touch now inhumane
Every waking hour
Awaiting a reverie to unfold
Louder by the minute

Calling me back to my home"

A dweller upon our lonesome
Isle, the last, lonely man? -

By the Gods he is there to
Never leave, to remain all his
Life. His punishment for
Evermore, to attend the
Eternal light.

The lighthouse, tall and brilliant
White, which stands at the end
Of the world. Protecting ships
And sailors too, from rock they
Could be hurled

Yet nothing comes and nothing
Goes 'sept the bright blue sea.
Which stretches near and far
Away, 't is all our man can see.

Though, one day, up high on
Rock, a bird did perch and cry.
An albatross, he shot a glance,
And wondered deeply, why?

Could it be a watcher sent?
A curse sent from the Gods,
Who sits and cries and stares at him,
The life that they have robbed.

Each year it comes to watch
Over him, the creature from above.
Not a curse but a reminder of
The woman that he loved.

- Oh weary night, under stars,
He'd lay and gaze.
Up towards the moon and stars.
The suns dying haze.

Time and again, Orion's light
Filled our man with joy.
Within the belt, he'd see his love,
Remembering her voice -

The twinkle from the stars above
Bled peace into his heart
As long as she looks down on him
He knows they'll never part

One day good, one day bad
The madness, the heat, the sun,
Out to sea, he spies upon land.
His beloved Albion.

Cliffs of white and trees of green
Children run and play,
'My home land' he cries and weeps,
Why so far away?

Eyes sore and red. Filled with tears,
He runs towards the sea.
To risk his life, a worthy cause,
For home he would be.

Into the sea, deep and blue,
The waters wash him clean.
Awake. He screams. Cold with sweat.
And Albion a dream.

- Such is life upon the isle,
Of torment and woe.
One day good. One day bad.
And some days, even hope.

The light at the end of the world
Burns bright for mile and mile
Yet tends the man, its golden glow,
In misery all the while?

For fifty years he stands and waits,
Atop the light, alone.
Looking down upon his isle
The Gods have made his home -

The watcher at the end of the world
Through misery does defile.
Remembers back to that single night
And allows a tiny smile.

(His sacrifice was not so great,
He insists upon the world.
Again he would crime,
Again he would pay,
For one moment with the girl)

Her hair, long and black it shone,
The dark, beauty of her eyes,
Olive skin and warm embrace,
Her memory never dies.

'Twas years ago, he
Remembers clear
The life they once did live.
Endless love and lust for life,
They promised each would give.

Alas, such love and laughter too,
Was short as panting breath
For one dark night, her soul
Was kissed
By the shade of death.

(Agony, like none before,
Was suffered by our man.)
Who tends the light now
Burning bright
On the very last of land.

(Anger raged and misery too
Like nothing ever before.)
He cursed the Gods and man
And life,
And at his heart he tore.

- A deity felt sympathy
And threw our man a light
'Your woman you may see again,
For a single night. -

But think hard and well young man,
There is a price to pay:
To tend the light at the end of
The world
Is where you must stay.

Away from man and life and love.
Alone you will be.
On a tiny isle. A bright shining isle
In the middle of the sea.'

- 'I'll tend the light, for one more night
With the woman whom I love',
Screamed the man, with tearful eyes,
To the deity above.

And so it was that very night
His lover did return.
To his arms and to their bed,
Together they did turn.

In deepest love and lust and passion
Entwined they did fall.
Lost within each other's arms
They danced (in lover's ball). -

- Long was the night filled with love.
For them the world was done.
Awoke he did to brightest light,
His woman and life had gone.

To his feet he leapt. To the sea he looked.
To the lighthouse on the stone.
The price is paid and from now on
He lives forever alone.

Fifty years have passed since then
And not a soul has he seen.
But his woman lives with him still
In every single dream.

'Tis sad to hear how young love has died
To know that, alone, someone has cried.
But memories are ours to keep.
To live them again, in our sleep.-"

When I pull out up front, you see the Benz on dubs
When I roll 20 deep, it's 20 knives in the club
Niggas heard I fuck with Dre, now they wanna show me love
When you sell like Eminem, and the hoes they wanna fuck

But, homie, ain't nothing change hoes down, G's up
I see Xzibit in the Cut, that nigga roll that weed up
If you watch how I move, you'll mistake me for a playa or pimp
Been hit wit' a few shells, but I don't walk wit' a limp (I'm 'aight)

In the hood, in L.A., they saying ""50 you hot""
They like me, I want them to love me like they love 'Pac
But holla, in New York them niggas'll tell ya I'm loco
And the plan is to put the rap game in a chokehold

I'm full of focused man, my money on my mind
I got a mill' out the deal and I'm still in the grind
Now shorty said she feeling my style, she feeling my flow
Her girlfriend wanna get bi and they ready to go (okay)

My flow, my show brought me the dough
That bought me all my fancy things
My crib, my cars, my clothes, my jewels
Look, nigga, I done came up and I ain't changed

And you should love it, way more then you hate it
Nigga, you mad? I thought that you'd be happy I made it
I'm that cat by the bar toasting to the good life
You that faggot ass nigga trying to pull me back right?

When my jaws get to bumpin' in da club it's on
I wink my eye at your bitch, if she smiles she gone
If the roof on fire, let the motherfucker burn
If you talking 'bout money, homie, I ain't concerned

I'm-a tell you what Banks told me 'cause go 'head switch the style up
If the niggas hate then let 'em hate and watch the money pile up
Or we go upside they head wit' a bottle of bub
They know where we fuckin' be

You find me in da club, bottle full of bub
Look, mami, I got the X, if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love

Disgust lies deep within your empty gaze...

Send stares into your meaningless eyes

Leaving my eyes to marvel the sky knowing it should be mine
Yet it's you I see wasting the dream that only I deserve

Did you fall when you found that you paid the price
Hope it wasn't lost in an honest truth
So the past doesn't break all that we've been through
Every little thing that you did was right
But who knows what you did on the day you cried
Endlessly, oh you cried endlessly

Take a message for my love, take a message for my love, take a message

Didn't mean to tell you why oh why

Of something brooding.
No way out of here.

Slow smouldering,
Slow rain (ing) heat.
Lapping at your skin
Pulling you down again.

I wish that I could
Fan back to life
The dying embers
Of my long lost passion.

Descending deeper.
With black as my light.
With twist and turn.
All men will be tried in life.

We look for light to call.
The call to save us all.
Lest we fall to our knees.
The death, we kiss his feet.
Oh, sacred mother come.
For our fate is done.
In blindness do we run
Always backwards.

The care of many
Was lost in my hands.
The sickness came in
Floods of torment and woe.

My withered body.
Aching and bone tired.
My Christ who art lord.
Hold me down again.

Knee bent and head held low.
Eyes closed against my foe.
In prayer I sing on low.
Answers to my last call.
Oh, sacred father come.
For it is you who's done.
In blindness do we (signs ""you will"") run.
And be sure not to fall.

Oh, Christ, what have I done?
Ill fortune now will come.
Fire raining from the sun.
All virtue swept away.
In floods of blackest death.
The ghost will take my breath.
My sins I will forget.
I am nothing again.

Exit the Ghost Lake.
The waters silent.
What now has risen?
No man stands alone.

The world is changing.

Leads our way now.

Never was a gangster, till I graduated to one

Took the image of a thug kept shit appealing

Willin' to stick out my neck for respect if it meant life or death
Never lived to regret what I said
When you're me, people just wanna see if its true
If it's you, what you say in your raps is what you do

So they feel, it's part of ya obligation to fulfill
When they see you on the streets face to face are you for real?
The confrontation ain't no conversation if you feel
You're in violation, any hesitation'll get you killed

Being reasonable will leave you full of bullets, pull it, squeeze it
Till its empty, tempt me, push me, pussies

You can hurt 'em then come back again and kick dirt in them
It's like pouring salt in your wounds, assault and get sued
You can smell the lawsuits as soon as I waltz in the room

Everybody's hearts just stop, they call the cops

Running and ducking at the Hot Rock's parking lot

Listen to the sound of me spilling my heart through this pen

Don't worry now it's all come back. Colorless as night. You'll be there, you'll see her face. And hear her all the while.

By the time you find your way, you're gonna run right back to the start. Don't think you're lost. You're gonna run right back to the start. And when you finally think it's gone, you're gonna run right back to her arms.

Don't worry now it's all erased, burned to grey and white. Tell yourself you don't still taste her. Or hear her through the night.

Run, run fast enough to lose yourself. Our legs were straight but only move in circles.

By the time you find your way, you're gonna run right back to the start. Don't thik you're lost. You're gonna run right back to the start. And when you finally think it's gone, you're gonna run right back to the start. You're gonna run right back to her arms."

When our backs were turned around
In a fleet of Lincoln Town Cars
They rolled into our town
Confounded all six senses
Like an opiate in the brain
Mary shut the garden door
Looks a lot like rain

Mary shut the garden door
Mary shut the garden door

We pounded Rachel's radio
For reports about the bridge
There was nothing on but static
Nothing in the fridge
We lay there listening to the wind
Whistling through the pines
When we heard the engines idling
Saw the headlights through the blinds

Mary shut the garden door
Mary shut the garden door

Rough dreams
Those voices in the kitchen
I woke up
And sensed the new condition
They won, storms raged
Things changed forever

Mary shut the garden door

So if you ever see an automaton
In a midprice luxury car
Better roll the sidewalks up
Switch on your lucky star
'Cause this zombie does impressions
But not really to amuse
This ballad is for lovers
With something left to lose

Mary shut the garden door

I know it's tricky when you're feeling low
When you feel like your flavour has gone the way
Of a pre-shelled pistachio
I know you're weighed down
And fed up with your heavy boots
Laced with melancholy notions all your own

I do - like sugar - tend toward the brittle and sticky when spun
And I know my demeanour can go the way
Of a photo left out in the sun
And I try to keep myself in lilies and flax seeds
Oh what a folly, fooling just yourself

Sit down and smoke away
I wouldn't knock it till you're in them shoes
I watch as our subtlety blows away
As a blush it gives way to a bruise
But seemly we'd freely make the trade off
A dry rot to take the weight off
And swap the boots for red shoes"

Might seem a bit unusual so I'll lay it on the line

Get behind and ride me 
Stuff your cock inside me 
Proceed to fuck me blindly 

You might think I'm dirty if I let you have your way 
That's the way that boys and girls have been raised to play 
If you can't control yourself in saying something more 
I can think of things to do with that mouth of yours 

You can eat me out 
With that dirty mouth 
Throw me on the couch 
Do it then get out... 

We don't have to do anything if you don't want 
We can just look into eachother's eyes 
And masturbate 

Two three four! 

Promise not to take from you without me giving back 
Love is love is love is love but this just isn't that 
Take a shower when we're done but this won't wash away 
If you keep me satisfied I might let you stay 

I will suck you off

P.S. you can keep all this shit
And hang around your broke friends and call yourself rich
Struggling I did with you was all for nothing
It was never enough, your heart set on suffering
I admit that I was weak in the beginning
I wanted someone to need me instead of a friendship
I didn't think I deserved a true partner
So I transferred the arrangement I had with my momma

I never fucked you right or made enough bread, I know
If I'm such a bastard and mistreated you so
Then how is it you're losing your mind to see me go?
Truth be told, I held you together
For all them years and I cheated on you never
Defended your honor, took in your momma
When she tried to rehab and had your back through the drama
You've got a sick stone under your ribs
Where a heart is supposed to live
Sick twisted and vindictive with your windows dim
Baby in that wicked hardboiled fist you must shiver
How you threaten to kill the most precious
Gift that you'll ever be blessed with
Unless you're twisted, demented, and depressed as shit
And alone 'cause you faithfully slayed your friendships
Since you never listened to a word I ever said
Maybe seeing this door slam will get it through your head
You don't love me; I don't think you ever did
And if you hadn't tried to kill me I'd have stayed for the kid

That he's something I know that he's not
He's like a blind bull in a china shop
When it comes to affairs of the heart

You wouldn't know what love is
If it hit you like a rock
And a girl like me is lost on you
If you don't know what you've got

Every breath in the park
Every dance in the dark
Every promise you make
You go and throw it away
Every smile in the rain
You know it's always the same
You go and do it again
You go and throw it away

You wouldn't know what love is
If it hit you like a rock
And a girl like me is lost on you
If you don't know what you've got"

We should have each other to tea, huh?
We should have each other with cream

Not broken in pieces like hated little mieces

And I'm dying in this summer heat
I hope like hell you're waiting, waiting

Everybody's living like they're crazy in love
I'm a dizzy mess, and everything is so above me
From the floor of any life I lead today

Well, they can take, take, take the kids from the summer
But they'll never, never, never take the summer from me
It was the very first time that I lost my mind for a week
They can make, make, make me forget the weather
If we'll never, never, never wash the sand from my feet
It was the very last time that we said goodbye to the beach
Showing off, we're showing off our teeth

So make one last call back home
Cause tonight we go it alone
And I hope that you know I'm waiting, waiting
(Summer, do you feel me?)

Everybody's singing like they're crazy in love
We made a dizzy mess of everything and it was enough
So bring all the boys and all the girls together

Well, they can take, take, take the kids from the summer

You're going out in style
And I'm getting tired of all your lying
(Summer, do you feel me?)
Stop pretending
Stop, the answer's in the smile
And I'm coming clean
(Summer, do you feel me?)
Just give me something

Stop pretending

I spent them all with you

Take ways by withered creeks
Lizards sunning in the streets
Small kitten stretches through
Green empty yards you knew

Weekend in san geronimo
Love how the starlit skies show
Weekend in san geronimo
Sentiment within me glows

Somewhere up fifteen miles
Barefoot on kitchen tile
Where nights are warm and true

My sweater is on backwards and inside out
And you say, ""How appropriate.""
I don't want to dissect everything today
I don't mean to pick you apart, you see
But I can't help it

And there I go jumping before the gunshot has gone off
Slap me with a splintered ruler
And it would knock me to the floor if I wasn't there already
If only I could hunt the hunter 

And all I really want is some patience
A way to calm the angry voice
And all I really want is deliverance 
Ahh...

Do I wear you out?
You must wonder why I'm relentless and all strung out
I'm consumed by the chill of solitary
I'm like Estella
I like to reel it in and then spit it out
I'm frustrated by your apathy

And I am frightened by the corrupted ways of this land
If only I could meet the Maker
And I am fascinated by the spiritual man
I'm humbled by his humble nature, yeah

And what I wouldn't give to find a soulmate
Someone else to catch this drift
And what I wouldn't give to meet a kindred
Ahh...

Enough about me, let's talk about you for a minute
Enough about you, let's talk about life for a while
The conflicts, the craziness
And the sound of pretenses falling all around, all around

Why are you so petrified of silence?
Here, can you handle this?
Did you think about your bills, your ex, your deadlines
Or when you think you're gonna die?
Or did you long for the next distraction?

And all I need now is intellectual intercourse
A soul to dig the hole much deeper
And I have no concept of time other than it is flying
If only I could kill the killer 

And all I really want is some peace, man
A place to find a common ground
And all I really want is a wavelength
Ahh...

And all I really want is some comfort
A way to get my hands untied
And all I really want is some justice

I've shown you everything
Give me a sign
Say something, say something, anything
Your silence is deafening
Pay me in kind

Take a drug to set you free
Strange fruit from a forbidden tree
You've got to come down soon
More than a drug is what I need
Need a change of scenery
Need a new life

Say something, say something anything
I've shown you everything
Give me a sign
Say something, say something, anything

Have you swallowed everything

1635,ML1636,Dan Le Sac vs Scroobius Pip,Look For The Woman,sad,"There's a weight over me today
It's something I have to say
Love you too much to leave
Don't like you enough to stay

My head's in a mess
And I'm stressed
But I guess it's a test in the quest for happiness
And the rest of that mess
So I best just acquiesce
Even though I've grown tired of you

And that ain't meant to sound spiteful
I'm just trying to be insightful
When I write all my emotions
In the night, all the stuff I try to fight
Will just come out and the sad fact is, I'm so tired of you

Love, it's a weird thing ain't it?
There's no way to explain it
But I swear, as well as pain
There should be joy, but we sustain
The same level of mundane,
And it's numbing me through

I often wonder if I'd miss you,
And still have the urge to kiss you,
If an issue was to hit through
To this heart that now feels disused,
And said issue was too big to just ignore
And I walked out on you?

The chances are I'd fall apart
And suffer seizures of the heart
As my chest begins to smart
The very second I depart
I'd want to go back to the start
But then again, maybe I'd just feel new.

Maybe I'd get my life on track
And start to focus my attack
On all the things my life just lacks
And start to claw my passion back
Instead of living like a hack,
Half-committed, half-relaxed
I'd have nothing to lose

There's a weight over me today
It's something I have to say
Love you too much to leave
Don't like you enough to stay

There's a weight over me today
It's something I have to say
Love you too much to leave
Don't like you enough to stay

I guess lately I've had too much time to think
And yeah, way too much drink
When paper meets the ink
Overthinking is the chink in my armour
That's just what I do
And I've always been that way,
Forever questioning each day
And every plea that's made
That maybe when I lay
My busy mind will make
Me prove by finding problems and reasons
That might not even be true.

See, we got together so young,
Before our real lives had begun
But flowers don't grow up as one
Each finds its own way to the sun
And that's exactly what we've done.

We've grown up separately too,

And for a few years now it's been the problem,
And these realisations, I wish that I could stop them,
But I've realised that love is all we have in common,
And deep down you know that's true.

But then surely that I'm still in love with you means there's something we can do
To get us through and to pursue a brand new point of view on how this gap grew,
Between me and you.

So there's a weight over me and I'd hate to have to leave,
But in fate I don't believe and the state of you and me isn't great as you can see
So I'll keep thinking this through.

There's a weight over me today
It's something I have to say
Love you too much to leave
Don't like you enough to stay

There's a weight over me today
It's something I have to say
Love you too much to leave
Don't like you enough to stay

There's a weight over me today
It's something I had to say
Love you too much to leave
Don't like you enough to stay

There's a weight over me today
It's something I have to say
Love you too much to leave
Don't like you enough to stay"

Police looking at niggaz through a microscope
In L.A. everybody and they momma sell dope
They trying to stop it
So what the fuck can I do to make a profit?
Catch a flight to St. Louis
That's cool, cause nobody knew us
We stepped off the plane
Four gang bangers, professional crack slangers
Rented a car at Wholesale
Drove to the ghetto, and checked in a motel
Unpacked and I grabbed the 3.80
'Cause where we staying, niggaz look shady
But they can't fade South Central
'Cause busting a cap is fundamental
Peeping out every block close
Seeing which one will clock the most
Yeah, this is the one, no doubt
Bust a U Bone, and let's clear these niggaz out

""Hey! Hey man! Whassup nigga?
This is Lynch Mob nigga"" (tires squeal)

Now clearing them out meant casualties
Still had the L.A. mentality
Bust a cap, and outta there in a hurry
Wouldn't you know, a drive-by in Missouri
Them fools got popped
Took their corner next day, set up shop
And it's better than slanging in the Valley
Triple the profit making more than I did in Cali
Breaking up rocks like Barney Rubble
'Cause them mark-ass niggaz don't want trouble
And we ain't on edge when we do work
Police don't recognize the khakis and the sweatshirts
Getting bitches and they can't stand a
1991 Tony Montana
Now the shit's like a war - Gang violence
Where it was never seen before
Punks run when the gats bust
4 jheri curled niggaz kicking up dust
And some of them are even looking up to us
Wearing our colors and talking that gang Fuck,
Giving up much much love
Dying for a street that they never heard of
But other motherfuckers want to stand strong
So you know the phrase, ""once again it's on...""

A gang from South Central Los Angeles, which are known for their drive-by shootings,
Have migrated into east St. Louis leaving 3 dead and 2 others injured. No arrests have
Been made. Police say this is a nation-wide trend, with similar incidents occurring in
Texas, Michigan, and Oklahoma.

Now the shit's gettin' tricky
'Cause now they looking for tha colorz and the Dickies
Damn, the spot's getting hot from the platter
I'm about to pack up and start slinging in Seattle
But the NARCs, raid about six in the morning
Try to catch a nigga while he's yawnin
Put his Glock to my chest as I paused
Went to jail in my motherfuckin drawers
Tryin' to give me, fifty-seven years
Face'll be full of those tattooed tears
It's the same old story and the same old nigga stuck
And the public defender ain't givin' a fuck
The fool must be sparkin
Talkin' about a double life plea bargain
You got to deal with the Crips and Bloods by hand G
Plus the Black Guerilla family
And the white pride don't like Northside
And it's a riot if any more niggaz die
No parole or probation
Now this is a young man's Summer Vacation
No chance for rehabilitation

I'mma end it like this 'cause you know what's up
My life is fucked

And all the dreams that I laid to rest
Are ghosts that keep me
After all that I've become
I am only one
I am only one

I close my eyes
And bleed this empty heart
Of all that longs to die
When faces lie and love will falter
I'm left with only time
And time will break the dreams that take the pain away

1641,ML1642,The Cat Empire,The Rhythm,happy,"And for all of the sweet loving that
I have received
In the sun in the rain
By the moon by the sea
There is one time that I'm thinking of
One time where one woman
Did knock me off my feet
And my knees were shaking
And my jaw was dropping
And my eyes were squinting
And my smile was growing
And my pants were bulging
And my hands were sweating
And my chest was beating
So I cry 'excuse me,
What is the secret to your song?'

'Cause when you're walking along
When you're walking along:

Your legs are a melody my hands
Would like to play
And your hips are a note
That does take me away
And your face and your eyes and your hair
And your waist and your smile
Drive me to distraction
She turned and she gave the evil eye
'Why thankyou' she said
Then she sigh 'ah there's one thing
I think you failed to mention:'
'What?' I said then she said
'It's the rhythm you forgot'
And right then I knew what was what
And she snuck to my lips
And she kissed them
Said 'young man
I'll show you some rhythm'

And she'll show you some rhythm

And since then ha
The rhythm's been running through my veins
In my thoughts in my eyes
In my head it's insane
It's the thing that does drive me
To scream
On the street when I think of some
Places it's taken me
I feel horny when I thinking of some of that rhythm in my mind
What she gave what she gives to me
All of the time
Say a little bit of sweet loving in your day
All my friends know it keeps the
Bad thoughts away
So sing with your hips my baby
When you're dancing to this tune
And when this tune is through
We'll sneak to some place
And continue to:
Say sing with your hips my baby
When you're dancing to this tune
And when this tune is through
We'll sneak to some place and
Continue to -
She said I'll show you some rhythm

And she'll show you some rhythm"

You don't seem to understand that I'm going
You don't seem to understand what I'm saying
You don't seem to understand that I'm going, going home alone

Rusbel awaits
I've been to the surface and nothing is there
Eyelids sank muffled in the nerve aura sound
But when she awakes, will she still be with us?
My heart is dark clots
Leap year is late
How did you get here? Ask all but the bait
From a Christ that went hissing, constricting his cells 
We summon by candle, by book, and by bell

Glossolalia coats my skin
Glycerin and turbulence
Stuffed the voice inside of God
Mirrors to the animals
Glossolalia coats my skin
Glycerin and turbulence

The sermon goes mourning
Pricking its hail
Slothful the child that preys on the seed
Shall behead the drought, wound under sleeves
I hope you have room in a thicket of vines
Give me a moment
To clean what you've stole
The streets will hang high, stretch ribs and let taste
We'll cover the smell with silver nitrate
Mending the cuts of your prosthetic faith

Glossolalia coats my skin
Glycerin and turbulence
Stuffed the voice inside of God
Mirrors to the animals
Glossolalia coats my skin
Glycerin and turbulence
Stuffed the voice inside of God
Mirrors to the animals

Then so long, dear mnemonic
Assume the form, you've given me and I'll spill
Now hold on, just hold my hand
Say that they made you but you brought your own leash
Tell me, ""No more no,"" say I'm the last one
Say I'm the last one

Outside by the drift
You read my will of thread and itch
Failure to comply as failure to decease
And still you won't know everything
I've built the fall

Sulking drained the fall of my pale will swarming by your steps
Licking the ankles of blasphemer guilts
It only meant to drape a plastic over the stuck pig scalp of head
To cover the sock where to flatline had spread
The kiosk in my temporal lobe is shaped like Rosalyn Carter
She says my map is home again but torn face down
I have only but a million blemishes to tell you all about
In the end they just gagged me to make him come out

Gas me the hind of your five legged snare
Tooth picks the eye but no things there
Down drags your waltz, cross the altar top
From a sleep that, deprivation knew
Trespass your form, I'm void of dusk
I'd ask to look but the mask stays on
You'll levitate, teutonic print
Cruelty is the wrath of my instrument
In the end they just gagged me to make him come out

You locked the cuffs, arsenic erupts
Will you drink the shadow of my red hair?
You and your false witness to God
You've one in the chamber but your finger got stuck
Let slip the sound of a cry for help
But all was lost on the night you walked
Palms speak through eyes, serve your memory lost
I contaminate with insignias
In the end they just gagged me to make him come out

Glossolalia coats my skin
Glycerin and turbulence
Stuffed the voice inside of God
Mirrors to the animals

Wait till I get my hands on you
I won't forget a face that lift me
Yeah, oh yeah
Just you wait till I get my hands on you
I can't, you won't remember
You won't remember, oh ah

Unwrap my corpse and let it thaw
In the eye of the needle, I can't get out
They'll check my wrist, I'll faint a pulse
I'm not the human you thought I was
If you pet the night, sixth pentacle dice
If you roll the seven, St. Michael dies
They'll be no ransom, don't shut my mouth
I scald the answer you're afraid of"

1645,ML1646,John Denver,Grandma's Feather Bed,happy,"When I was a little bitty boy
Just up off the floor
We used to go down to grandma's house
Ev'ry month end or so
We'd have chicken pie and country ham
And homemade butter on the bread
But the best darn thing about Grandma's house
Was a great big feather bed

It was nine feet high and six feet wide
Soft as a downy chick
It was made from the feathers of forty 'leven geese
Took a whole bolt of cloth for the tick
It'd hold eight kids 'n' four hound dogs
And a piggy we stole from the shed
We didn't get much sleep but we had a lot of fun
On grandma's feather bed

After supper we'd sit around the fire
The old folks'd spit and chew
Pa would talk about the farm and the war
And granny'd sing a ballad or two
I'd sit and listen and watch the fire
Till the cobwebs filled my head
Next thing I'd know I'd wake up in the morning
In the middle of the old feather bed

It was nine feet high and six feet wide
Soft as a downy chick
It was made from the feathers of forty 'leven geese
Took a whole bolt of cloth for the tick
It'd hold eight kids 'n' four hound dogs
And a piggy we stole from the shed
We didn't get much sleep but we had a lot of fun
On grandma's feather bed

Well I love my ma, I love my pa
I love granny and grandpa too
I've been fishin' with my uncle, I rassled with my cousin
I even kissed Aunt Lou, eww!
But if I ever had to make a choice
I guess it ought to be said
That I'd trade 'em all plus the gal down the road
For grandma's feather bed

It was nine feet high and six feet wide
Soft as a downy chick
It was made from the feathers of forty 'leven geese
Took a whole bolt of cloth for the tick
It'd hold eight kids 'n' four hound dogs
And a piggy we stole from the shed

Watch me bash this beat like a skull
Dont'cha know I had beef with
Why don't you riff with me?

And when I pull out my jammy, get ready, 'cause it might go blauh!

You to get with Mr. Smith

On a PR campaign to try and convince you they're fair and balanced

And if you fail, well then you fail, but not to us

I know they have been hard
But now it's time to get out of the desert and into the sun

And that's the way it's been
Ever since we were kids, but now
Now, we've got something to prove

And I, I can see their eyes
But tell me something, can they see mine?

And I'm no good with sad news anymore
Gets me running upstairs
To count heads in tangled beds

And someone tears up that uniform
And somewhere gently closes a door
And I'm right here once more
Crying, confessing, counting my blessings

Don't let go
'Cause we'll never know
That even when the sky is clear
And the moon looks really close
Well it's nowhere near"

Lá fora está chovendo
Mas assim mesmo eu vou correndo
Só pra ver o meu amor
Ela vem toda de branco
Toda molhada, linda e despenteada
Que maravilha, que coisa linda
Que é o meu amor
Por entre bancários, jatomóveis
Ruas e avenidas
Milhoes de buzinas tocando em harmonia
Sem cessar
E ela vem chegando de branco
Meiga, pura, linda e muito tìmida
Com a chuva molhando seu corpo lindo
Que eu vou abraçar
E a gente no meio da rua do mundo
No meio da chuva
A girar, que maravilha
A girar"

Close your eyes and just sleep tight
I'll lie awake and watch you dream
To be sure that all of your dreams are pure

My dear don't you worry 'bout a thing
I'll be near to you all night
And through the evening
I'll be by your side

So goodnite
Close your eyes and just sleep tight
I'll lie awake and watch you dream
To be sure that all of your dreams are pure

While you slumber
In case you ever wonder
If a summer breeze just brushed your cheek
Know it's me

Close your eyes and just sleep tight
I'll lie awake and watch you dream
To be sure that all of your dreams are pure"

I don't know how I feel
You almost make me doubt I feel at all

But there's just so much I don't hear
Maybe I'll never be what you want
I know that all you're asking for
Is a little place in my heart
But I don't find it easy to give

Maybe I get a little selfish sometimes
Why shouldn't I?
I used to say I love you
But would it make a difference this time?

And who am I to tell you that I would never let you down
That no one else could love you half as much as I do now
And who am I to tell you I'll always catch you when you fall
Well I, I wouldn't be myself at all
I wouldn't be myself at all, at all.

I always find a reason why I didn't put you first
It's not that complicated I know
I really hate it when you shake your head like this ain't gonna work
Maybe you'll never reap what you sow

I didn't want to do what everybody does
And hide the truth to find we never knew a thing about love
'Cause this is real life, real love
And knowing what it comes down too
It just might be enough"

Got blood on his shoes and mud on his brim
Did he do it to himself or was it done to him?

People say that he don't look well
But all he needs from what I can tell
Is someone to help wash away all the paint
From his purple hands before it gets too late

I saw him stand alone
Under a broken street light
So sincere ... singing silent night
But the trees were full
And the grass was green
It was the sweetest thing I had ever seen

But that don't mean he's going nowhere
He may be moving slow
But that don't mean he's going nowhere"

It feels like some Saturday cartoon, oh yeah
If I could tell ya, yeah, the way that I feel
Would you believe enough in magic
And carnival wheels?

Life is never say you're sorry
Love is never make mistakes
Life is telling me the answer
If I can't believe the rain

I meant to tell you I'm sorry
For all the hurt and senseless pain
I need to tell you I'm sorry
For all the love we never got to make

Calling me back
To the room on the hill
Say that the lie
Can't be right

Well there's nothing moving here,
And all your burning questions, they just get answered with another one,
And there's no help at all.

So question me no questions,
It's a pointless enterprise,
You ask and I'll only tell you what I think you want to hear,
Oh mind the whitest lies.

And faith is for losers like us,
And secrets are for people who intend to get away with being in the wrong,

Save your breath,
For the talking all night, oh...
Save you breath,
For the laughing aloud, again.

Will you listen to their bleeding hearts?
Pretend to show concern,
And so we glanced our watches and join in as everybody sings,
Oh what have we become?

Will you hop a train to anywhere?
It sure ain't no place like home,
Where there are no strangers,
Only people you don't wanna know,

But before the crying out loud...

Just save your breath,
For the laughing aloud, again.
Save your breath,
For the talking all night, oh.
Save your breath,
For the laughing aloud, oh.
Save your breath,

Save your breath.

So meet me by the station,
And bring a change of heart,
And smile away the old country as we watch it disappear
And pull these years apart.

And scatter from the window,
To settle on the fields,
And tell yourself a hundred times that forever starts today,
And think how good it feels.

To save your breath,
For the laughing aloud, again.
Save your breath,
For the talking all night, oh.
Save your breath,
For the laughing aloud, again.
Save your breath,

Save your breath,

To save your breath,

For the talking all night, oh.
Save your breath,
For the laughing aloud, oh.

Save your breath,

Kids still call each other names
Should get better, but it's sad and strange
Every insult still the same

Growing up in small town hell
They bide their time till the dinner bell
Take a swing with a bag, and they wait
By the school gate

All this pushin and shovin
When you need a little lovin'
A little human kindness
But where you gonna find it?

So you close your bedroom door
And you kneel down on the floor
Cause you don't want to get caught
Packing the bag that your mother doesn't even
Know you bought


""So it's come to this"" you cry
Not even time to say goodbye
You pack some cigarettes and an A-Z
Push the suitcase back under the bed

You've been balanced on a knife
Will the city save your life?
You've been waiting for so long
Just for somewhere to feel like home

You've been balanced on a knife
Will the city save your life?
Your life is waiting for you
Love is waiting for you

So pack your cigarettes
And your A-Z
It'll be just like that book you read"

Seduced by an ocean of discontent
Carrying an everlasting smile with insouciance
Cultivating this disconnection with every single interaction

You won't lure me any further
I've been drinking too much shadow and now maybe I shall blossom
This misconception of human loneliness must be disregarded

I will stare at life like I never did before
This game is useless and everything so deceptive
My ambitions may look low but so is the price. I cannot win
What's the meaning of this precious souvenir?
Suppress these feelings

Forget the man you were
Even if we both knew that you'd rather be unloved and...
Forget the man you were
...Nameless than be fictively surrounded

Carrying an everlasting smile with insouciance
I honestly know that demons will not hear me scream
And angels won't see me cry
Isolation is in the fact that the only thing I require
No false promises await in my nightmares
Nothing, except my own predestined downfall
Look at this smile and think I'm cheerful like you always were..."

Of all those blinking lights, you had to pick the one tonight

Holes, dug by little moles, angry jealous spies
Got telephones for eyes, come to you as friends
All those endless ends, that can't be tied
Oh, they make me laugh, and always make me cry

How to kill a king
Use his madness against him
Forsake everything
Though his grip is so tight
And it's choking me
I will find a way out
Of this loyalty

Just when I thought I was
Running out of time
The King stood trembling at my bedside
He said ""if you leave me now,
My suicide will follow""
And I said ""what are you waiting for?""

Now I know
How to kill a king
Now he suffers in silence
With a poisonous sting
He could not steal my might
And it seems to be
I have found a way out
Of his loyalty

I know that I can survive
Outside this cage
Maybe now I can fight through
All this rage

How to kill the King
I tore down the boundaries
And took off the ring
To reap what you sow
Is how it should be

I got so brave, drink in hand, lost my discretion
It's not what I'm used to, just wanna try you on
I'm curious for you caught my attention

I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry ChapStick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it

It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it

No, I don't even know your name, it doesn't matter
You're my experimental game, just human nature
It's not what good girls do, not how they should behave
My head gets so confused, hard to obey

I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry ChapStick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it

It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it

Us girls we are so magical
Soft skin, red lips, so kissable
Hard to resist, so touchable
Too good to deny it
Ain't no big deal, it's innocent

I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry ChapStick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it

It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight

1678,ML1679,Tom Waits,Cold Cold Ground,sad,"Crestfallen sidekick in an old cafe
Never slept with a dream before he had to go away
There's a bell in the tower, Uncle Ray bought a round
Don't worry about the army in the cold, cold ground
Cold, cold ground
Cold, cold ground
Cold, cold ground

Now don't be a cry baby when there's wood in the shed
There's a bird in the chimmney and a stone in my bed
When the road's washed out, they pass the bottle around
And wait in the arms of the cold, cold ground
The cold, cold ground
The cold, cold ground
The cold, cold ground

There's a ribbon in the willow, there's a tire swing rope
And a briar patch of berries taking over the slope
The cat'll sleep in the mailbox, and we'll never go to town
'Til we bury every dream in the cold, cold ground
In the cold, cold ground
The cold, cold ground
In the cold, cold ground
In the cold, cold ground

Give me a Winchester rifle and a whole box of shells
Blow the roof off the goat barn, let it roll down the hill
The piano is firewood, Times Square is a dream
I find we'll lay down together in the cold, cold ground
The cold, cold ground
The cold, cold ground
In the cold, cold ground

Call the cops on the Breedloves, bring a Bible and a rope
And a whole box of rebel and a bar of soap
Make a pile of trunk tires and burn 'em all down
Bring a dollar with you, baby, in the cold, cold ground
In the cold, cold ground
In the cold, cold ground
In the cold, cold ground

Take the weathervane rooster, throw rocks at his head
Stop talking to the neighbors until we all go dead
Beware of my temper and the dog that I've found
Break all the windows in the cold, cold ground
In the cold, cold ground
In the cold, cold ground
In the cold, cold ground

Used to like me to spank him and cum in his mouth
And Tony he was Italian (Uh-huh)

Shed our skin, let the sun shine in
At the edge of the ocean

There's a world I've always known
Somewhere far away from home
When I close my eyes I see
All the space and mystery

We can begin again
Shed our skin, let the sun shine in
At the edge of the ocean
We can start over again

1697,ML1698,Leonard Cohen,The Old Revolution,sad,"I finally broke into the prison,
I found my place in the chain.
Even damnation is poisoned with rainbows,
All the brave young men
They're waiting now to see a signal
Which some killer will be lighting for pay.

Into this furnace I ask you now to venture,
You whom I cannot betray.

I fought in the old revolution
On the side of the ghost and the King.
Of course I was very young
And I thought that we were winning;
I can't pretend I still feel very much like singing
As they carry the bodies away.

Into this furnace I ask you now to venture,
You whom I cannot betray.

Lately you've started to stutter
As though you had nothing to say.
To all of my architects let me be traitor.
Now let me say I myself gave the order
To sleep and to search and to destroy.

Into this furnace I ask you now to venture,
You whom I cannot betray.

Yes, you who are broken by power,
You who are absent all day,
You who are kings for the sake of your children's story,
The hand of your beggar is burdened down with money,
The hand of your lover is clay.

Into this furnace I ask you now to venture,
You whom I cannot betray."

By summer it was all gone - now she's moved on
She called you every other day
So savour it it's all gone - now she's moved on

Everything seemed new
Did we connect?
Or was it all just biding time for you?

She's all by herself
I try and knock her off her feet

'Cause she'll never break, never break, never break, never break

You'll only make me glad

I ain't the kind to meet

Leanin' on the back door
A couple Jills with their eyes on a couple bills
Their eyes was statin'
They was waitin'
To get their hands on some easy money

They flipped a dime
One said "" well, I'll take heads this time""
One stepped up
One stepped back
One loosened her shoulder strap
She couldn't speak,
Her knees got weak
She could almost taste that easy money

There was this old black cat
Sittin' in a old black cadillac
The Joe smelled sweet
She curled up at her boyfriend's feet
She said ""I got a plan
Listen, Sam, how'd ya like to make some easy money ? ""
He say, ""yes! oh yes!
Jus' tell me what you want me to do""
She said, ""Baby, you can trust me
Baby, but you must be hidin' in my room
At a quarter to two""
Well, the cat told the boy
""Come up to the room and play with my toy""
But the Jill set the bait
And she wasn't gonna sit around and wait
But this guy was wise to all the lies
And he flies out the door
With the easy money

Because there ain't no man
Who got the money in his hand
Who got any of that bread
Bein' slow in the head
The easier it looks
The hotter it hooks
There ain't no such thing as easy money
We say, ""yes! oh yes!""

Between two dames who was losin' the same game

1705,ML1706,Björn Rosenström,Lurad,happy,"I går kväll ringde jag på en kontaktannons i tidningen,
Idag så fick jag träffa henne som jag ringt till
Nyfiken på vad det var för gris i säck jag hade köpt
Ringde jag på dörren och så öppnade hon
Hon kom ifrån Arboga, jag synade henne noga
Och efter ordentligt övervägande jag sa:

Det stod att du var snygg
Men du är ful, jag har blivit lurad 
Du skrev nåt om ett slott,
Det här är ett skjul, jag har blivit lurad

Nu är det faktiskt så, sa hon, att jag tycker att jag är snygg,
Så du kan inte stämma mig för lureri
Jag skiter väl i stämning, sa jag, men jag kräver att
Du ber om ursäkt och erkänner att du ser ut som stryk
Men jag fick inte ut ett jota, trots att jag hota
Med att rycka hår ur hennes snok

Det stod att du var snygg
Men du är ful, jag har blivit lurad 
Du skrev nåt om ett slott,
Det här är ett skjul, jag har blivit lurad

Nu satt jag uti klistret, ni förstår hur svårt jag hade
Jag kunde inte dra mig ur med äran i behåll
Jag var redan sur, men när jag fick dörren rätt i nyllet
Balla jag ur och börja gå bärsärkargång
Jag fick upp en sten och drog den genom hennes fönster
Sen tryckte jag in huvudet mitt så långt jag kunde och skrek:

Det stod att du var snygg
Men du är ful, jag har blivit lurad 
Du skrev nåt om ett slott,
Det här är ett skjul, jag har blivit lurad
 
Han är blåst, han är blåst, han har blivit lurad,
Han får gå hem med svansen mellan benen
Han är blåst, han är blåst, han har blivit lurad,
Han får gå hem med svansen mellan benen

Han får gå hem med svansen mellan benen
Han är blåst, han är blåst, han har blivit lurad,

So you're wasting your life

You pack your cases and you hope for a better day
Mama's all right she said she didn't want you love
Clean town if you want to get away, you pack your cases
And you hope for a better day
Joni's all right she said she didn't want your love

Won't you walk down the main street
Take the bridge over never ending rails
And even if you're falling down
That's an open door to the outside world
So you live in a bubble
So you've wasting your life
On a system you never will understand

I bet her mama never told her why

As long as anyone with hot blood can
And now she's looking for a downtown man

She wants from her time
And when she wakes up
And makes up her mind

Nicky:
She'll see I'm not so tough
Just because
I'm in love with an uptown girl

You know I've seen her in her uptown world
She's getting tired of her high class toys
And all her presents from her uptown boys
She's got a choice

Ooh

Uptown girl
You know I can't afford to buy her pearls
But maybe someday when my ship comes in
She'll understand what kind of guy I've been
And then I'll win

And when she's walking
She's looking so fine
And when she's talking
She'll say that she's mine

Did you get all you want?
Did you drink their world dry
And extinguish all the sunshine?

I didn't say that I felt the same
You just took it as read
As I closed all the blinds
And put you to bed
And read you all the last rites

It serves as a warning to me,
Just like most of these days do
'Cause I just wish that
I could've just left you there
Sitting in your own shit
'Cause I know that you would, me too

See, 'cause I've gone through all this before
And I've bought that skinny tee
With a big, black gaping hole where the heart should be
That says, ""Baby, I renounce thee""

Don't you die on me now

A kiss is now a circus show
The big, top tent and neon glow
Through spectacles of rainbow red
You never feel your love till it's dead

Arm's length keep him
Stop and don't endure
No one ever paused
Empty as a hole and ever depleting

What I'm for makes us whole
A bankruptcy of love
Could not swim above
Empty as a hole and ever depleting

I recoil from the blast
And look around me
Neither friend nor foe
Empty as a hole and ever depleting"

You'd only lay me down

On sheets that tore and gave out

I'd never known anyone till now

Cause you belong in poetry

And you belong in fine things

But you belong to someone else

Yeah, you belong in prairie

And you belong in black sea

And I built it with rock

Things that I'm not
And I watch from the hill
As it burns to the ground
I can still see the smoke
From my train out of town

Everything I build is breaking down

I close my eyes
Scared of what I saw
Are you mad at all?
Been an open book
Been a slamming door
Apple of the trojan war

Everything I build is breaking down

Dance a little bit
Take a chance

Deeply twined inside of her mind
A tried and confined egret
That pines to fly south
To this mouth of mine

Pity

Too long have these emotions
Like potions, made me
A sole castellan
Trusted to keep
The weight of oceans
From her rusted gates of sleep

A dreaming angel
Lying curled in the circles of Hell
I must protect her
Watch her back for any cracks to occur
For in the witching hour
She slips into the underworld
A pearled Persephone
Deflowered by the powers
Hat around her
Down her
Whirl

Doomed to damn the rift
Across the shifting abyss
With her body and it's gift
My filthy little secret

I serve her slender hope
To preserve mankind from old ghosts
Disturbed though by recurring crimes
I sense that dead
Might be best for both

Pity

Too long have these emotions
Like potions, made me
A sole castellan
Posted to keep
Slow wheels in motion
From the human race to beat

Without her there
My nymphetamine with the faraway stare
Thin walls would crumble
Horrors would corroborate from dogstar lairs
For in the dead of the night
She spasms with orgasmic flare
This reamed Demeter
With Poseidons there inside her
Too appeased to grieve our air

Doomed to dam the rift
Across the shifting abyss
With her body and it's gift
My filthy little secret

Forever sworn to keep it
My filthy little secret
She makes me borne

Pity
Too long this urchin princess
Has incensed, made me
A wanton felon
Searching for the key
To lose her harness
And set desires lurching free

Without her there
My nymphetamine with the faraway stare
Thin walls would crumble
Horrors would corroborate from dogstar lair
But in her room at night
I care not for the underworld
Slathering and gathering emboldened Reichs
To breach, to teach
A dread thereafter

I would risk all this
For one minute of bliss
With her body and it's gift
My filthy little secret

Forever sworn to keep it
My filthy little secret

I know a deeper beauty shines
Beyond the veil
Her roots and creepers mine
As the worms beneath arise"

And I watched the world being reborn, till one a.m.

The city looked wonderful that way

No deed or dividend, some may ask why

Only to tear the whole world down.

Take it all and take the fall for you.
Fear is all I hold
Bound and beaten down
All the pain I can't escape today
Is always with me

The love I had in store you raped for more
And all the dreams I had in here you've just stolen
You peasants didn't even care
But the dreams I had for her you cannot touch, my golden hand
'Cause it's guarded by your promises

I met her in a crowded room where the bookshelves help you and knowledge takes your hand
I watched her beauty from an armchair
I said ""Hey girl have you seen that film with those kids in New York in the eighties
Oh, you have - Well, can I watch it with you anyway?""

To the head to get our ambitions in gear
For example, Jude at the party was taking her clothes off
Below the constellations

Outside the people, they pranced becoming lord of the dance
Another typical social plights
We greeted them with conversation and delight
Since Jude was mad at her dream for landing nowhere near the marker

To a boat on a island where nobody's been
Except your best memories and your favorite friends
There ain't no self fished for dinner

This is a place, is a place, is a place, is a place
Is a place that's soft down in a chair
We'll talk till the break, till the break, till the break
Till the sun comes up like the signal flare

Jude trailed off the trail, got her tail caught in a fail-proof safe
Didn't really fail for a night in jail with pale hail of everywhere
The nightingale did escape the whale
Couldn't we survive, they are fed alive, we all cried
Because she went and jumped overboard

She took a sad song, made it sadder
She took a sad song, made it sadder
She took a sad song, made it sadder
She took a sad song, made it sadder

1773,ML1774,The Arrogant Worms,Johnny Came Home Headless,happy,"Oh, Johnny was a tall man but his memory was short
He'd forget to duck at doorways and often he'd get hurt
I took good care of him for he had no family
Actually he did, but he forgot who they be

Johnny often liked to go out on the town
He'd forget where he'd be going so he'd just wander around
I when he was back for I would hear the smack
Of his head hitting the doorway but tonight it was alack

Johnny came home headless, it was a great disgrace
But wherever it's a-lying there's a smile upon his face
I should have seen it coming, he finally lost his mind
But if his head don't turn up soon then all his hats are mine

Johnny came towards me but suddenly he stopped
As if trying to think of something but having no luck
Still he didn't notice that his head weren't there
Till he took out a brush and tried to comb his hair

I said, ""Johnny where's your cranium?"" but he didn't seem to know
He just shrugged his shoulders and tried to find his nose
And the sight of him there topless made me start to cry
For I feared we'd ne'er again see eye to eye

Johnny came home headless, it was a great disgrace
But wherever it's a-lying there's a smile upon his face
I should have seen it coming, he should have stayed in bed
For now I fear he'll spend his life just trying to get ahead

Refusing to believe that he had split for good
His lower half and me searched the neighbourhood
It soon became apparent that his head we wouldn't find it
He could not retrace his steps, he was absent minded

Well years went by till late one night I heard a voice I swore
Was Johnny calling out to me, I flung open the door
Johnny's head was home, it took a taxi cab
Alas, it was too late, his body had gone bad

Johnny's head was homeless, his body was cremated
And the funeral was harder than he had anticipated
I should have seen it coming he said in his eulogy
But never thought I'd have to say I ain't got no-body

(I ain't got nobody)

Johnny came home headless, it was a great disgrace
But now his head's upon a shelf, a smile upon his face
But now his head's upon a shelf, a smile upon his face"

You gotta deal with this cause there's no way out,
Why? Cash money ain't never gonna play out.
I got nothin' to lose, much to gain,
In my brain, I got a capitalist migraine.
I gotta get paid tonight, you muthafuckin right.

So many hos on my jock, think I'm a movie star.
Nineteen, I got a fifty thousand dollar car.

I know it's real, it's gotta be real.
Man, you the flyest nigga I seen in my life!
Yo man, I just wanna roll with you man,
How can I be down?

What's up? You say you wanna be down?
Ease back, or muthafucka get beat down.
Out my face, fool I'm the illest,
Bulletproof, I die harder than Bruce Willis.
Got my crew in effect, I bought 'em new Jags,
So much cash, gotta keep it in Hefty bags.
All I think about is keys and Gs
Imagine that, me workin at Mickey D's (ha ha ha ha).
That's a joke 'cause I'm never gonna be broke,
When I die there'll be bullets and gunsmoke.

Here I come, so you better break North,
As I stride, my gold chains glide back and forth.
I care nothing 'bout you, and that's evident.
All I love's my dope and dead presidents.
Sound crazy? Well it isn't.
The ends justifies the means, that's the system.
I learned that in school then I dropped out,
Hit the streets, checked a grip, and now I got clout.
I had nothing, and I wanted it.
You had everything, and you flaunted it.
Turned the needy into the greedy,
With cocaine, my success came speedy.
Got me twisted, jammed into a paradox.
Every dollar I get, another brother drops.
Maybe that's the plan, and I don't understand,
God damn----you got me sinkin in quicksand.
But since I don't know, and I ain't never learned,
I gotta get paid, I got money to earn.
With my posse, out on the ave,
Bump my sounds, crack a forty and laugh.
Cool out and watch my new Benz gleam,
Is this a nightmare? Or the American dream?
So think twice if you're coming down my block,
You wanna journey through hell? Well shit gets hot.
Pregnant teens, children's screams,
Life is weighed on the scales of a triple beam.
You don't come here much, and ya better not.
Wrong move (bang), ambulance cot.
I gotta get more money than you got,
So what, if some muthafucka gets shot?
That's how the game is played,
Another brother slayed, the wound is deep
BUT they're givin' us a Band Aid.
My education's low but I got long dough,
Raised like a pit bull, my heart pumps nitro.
Sleep on silk, lie like a politician,
My Uzi's my best friend, cold as a mortician.
Lock me up, it's genocidal catastrophe,
There'll be another one after me!

Countless times you have fallen weird one
I'm gonna ask the judge for a party crack down
A weirdo wack down hangin' out on streets in cars in bars
Outside my window in my pool in my bed in my head

Oh but somehow someway somewhere you get back on your partied
Out feet, hello hello, party weirdo...
It's just so exotic you got no where left to go, Party weirdo
You will ask yourself who am I what am I where am I
You will answer I am no one probably nothing
I know that I'm nowhere you poor crass animal ok I'm new around town
Can anybody tell me what all these party weirdos are all about
Someone says you must go there and check out the party weirdos
Now all I see is a lot of young people all mixed up
It's just not fair countless times you have fallen weird one partied out yet

But it does not subside it sort of grows and grows and grows man
You can just go find somewhere else to go 'cause you're just not welcome here any more"

And see it shattering me - it doesn't matter to me
And I'm not sadder for seeing it come
I'm not going to run
I will just come when I am called
You want to cut me off
Because I took too much
But don't leave me alone
Take off your scarves, your winter coat
The night's too cold

When we met I should have said
You're like a sister to me
How all that kiss her just seem
Like puny suitors I can see through
And none will do, not for you
It might as well be just us two
But when I pulled you by the jacket
From the clattering street
You started flattering me
You started saying I was so strong
String me along, but I can't become all that I'm called
And I can't claim to know
What makes love die or grow
But I can still take control
And so refuse to just go home
Back down the hall

And as I crawl
As finally all the false confetti blooms up in this attic room
I'm going make my stand
I want to see both of your hands
Put down the phone
I won't let you go
Although the moment stole my self-control
From us all and it can only end, end with a fall"

You talk forever on the phone
To your mother and with my thoughts I'm left alone
Now and then I think how strange our love has grown
For your lover give some time
I will give up these cigarettes
Stay at home and watch you mend a tear in your dress
Have your name in a rose tattooed across my chest
And be your lover for all time
Maybe I will drink a little less
Come home early and not complain about the day
And give you flowers from the graveyard now and then
For your lover give some time

I think of places that I've seen
A skipping stone across the ocean I have been
A rootless man with no one else to share my dreams
And for my lover gave no time
Here's a toast to you, Helene
To all the cinemas we ran in from the rain
Laughing, clutching soaking newspapers to your face
And for your love you gave some time
I will give up these cigarettes
Stay at home and watch you mend the tears in your dress
Have your name in a rose tattooed across my chest
And be your lover for all time

1792,ML1793,Moxy Früvous,Entropy,happy,"Lyrics by Jack Micay

(Mike in a deep voice)
Galileo, Netwon, Watt, they were genuises all.
Without them we'd be freezing in the dark at the mall.
James Joule found total energy remains the same
(Murray)
No matter what it's form.
(Mike)
That's why it carries his name.

(Jian)
Mechanical, electrical, potential and heat,
Radiant, kinetic, ooh the list is incomplete.
They're always changing back and forth
It's really quite a blur
(Murray)
Oh, how could he?
(Jian)
I've forgotten nuclear!

(All)
Ride a barrel down the falls
Then cook spaghetti with meatballs.
Really make your friends amazed.
Nuke it with some gamma rays.
Fly to Venus in a rocket.
Put your finger in a socket.
You may suffer from exhaust,
But none of that energy is ever really lost.

(Murray)
Then why can't we make a clean machine that moves perpetually?
Cause there's another law with which all energy must agree.
Whenever it changes form, it loses quality

(Dave)
In other words...

(Murray)
Down/Damn that rising entropy!

(Dave)
It's entropy you see that turns finess into mess
A palace to a pig-stye why it's simply scandalous!
Energy once neat degenerates into waste heat (We must repeat.)
Because of entropy.

High above the water, feel disconnected and free 
Tired of hopes that I just can't run from 
I travel in secret, I know they're pursuing me 

Morning that falls represents a weak link 
After is after night's work is done 
There's no sun, just a grey horizon 
Hiding from heaven another frozen world 

Watch the ship hold to its course 
As an act of devotion 
And me, I'm lost at sea 
Going through the motions 

Gave all my passion to the ocean 
She holds it for me in reserve 
My word is gone into remission 
Your love's a tragedy that I don't deserve 

She said, ""You're only growing now."" 
She said, ""Soon have we begun, then she can have you. 
But until then, you're mine."" 

I watch her hold to her course 
As an act of devotion 
And me, I'm riding high 
Going through 

Seems like every flash in her eye's 
An act of devotion 
And me I'm lost in her hands 
Going through the motions 

Shore far away off the port side 
Shore far away off the bow 
Shore far away off the starboard side 
Shore far away from now"

It took me way back

Back down memory lane
I see us standing there
Such a happy, happy pair
Love beyond compare
Look a there, look a there
The way you held me
No one could tell me that love would die
Oh why did I have to find this photograph
I thought I had forgot the past
Now I'm slippin' fast
Oh back down memory lane
I feel the happiness, I feel the pain
Here am I back down memory lane
I'm in the sunshine
I'm in the rain
I thought it was over
Here I go again
The way you held me
No one could tell me that love would die

I don't wanna go
Travel up and down
Faster that the speed of sound
Back down memory lane
You steal my foolish heart
Don't let this feeling start

Well I lived with a child of snow
When I was a soldier,
And I fought every man for her
Until the nights grew colder.

She used to wear her hair like you
Except when she was sleeping,
And then she'd weave it on a loom
Of smoke and gold and breathing.

And why are you so quiet now
Standing there in the doorway?
You chose your journey long before
You came upon this highway.

An' cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up

Well, I was raised up beneath the shade of a Georgia pine
And that's home you know
Sweet tea, pecan pie and homemade wine
Where the peaches grow
And my house, it's not much to talk about
But it's filled with love that's grown in Southern ground

And a little bit o' chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
I like to see a sunrise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

Well, it's funny how it's the little things in life
That mean the most
Not where you live, what you drive or the price tag on your clothes
There's no dollar sign on a peace of mind; this I've come to know
So if you agree, have a drink with me
Raise your glasses for a toast

To a little bit o' chicken fried
An' cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well, I've seen a sunrise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

I thank God for my life
And for the stars and stripes
May freedom forever fly
Let it ring
Salute the ones who died
The ones that give their lives
So we don't have to sacrifice
All the things we love

Like our chicken fried
An' cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
I like to see the sunrise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

Get ya little chicken fried
An' cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right

1803,ML1804,David Holmes,Gritty Shaker,happy,"I'm sittin' at a coffee table, unable to see straight
Watchin' parallel lines unwind and undulate
Behind the rain-streaked windowpane, the scene's bleak
Another train leavin' home
Conceding defeat with a low moan

Hangin' in a sky, made of stone
Everybody's leavin' home, I called my man Jerome
To come meet me in the twilight zone
Leave your mobile phone at home and come alone

I bought him coffee and a snack
Settled back, started speakin'
He was tweakin' with the peak of his cap
While I'm seekin' to discover what it takes to stay sober
Not cover my mistakes
Try to maybe make sense of the evidence
It's over, she's gone for good
Why should I lie, singin' a killer's lullaby
Identified by the dying ring of her goodbye
The last thing you hear before your life disappear

Now it just gets worse, like my stomach will burst
Feel like I've been cursed
With seven centuries of bitter memories
And inadequacies, previous he's and she's
I'm movin' round this old house for the last time
Scene of my past crimes, been here for lifetimes
Hearin' the chimes of the old clock that used to mock

You got eternity for takin' stock
This place is like a padlock
You look shocked
Trust me, nothing ever moves but the dust
There's just us and I'm here to torment and tease
And that's how it was for centuries
Me and my memories, till you brought the keys

Took the couple of Saturdays
I moved in runnin' from tragedies and boozing
Seven hundred years since I came here
You appear, same hair, same quizzical stare
I couldn't get near
And the sheer frustration was more than I could bear
I was really cursed, thought I'd been through the worst part

That was just the first part, just the start
Every night I'd be sitting with dread, breaking my heart
In case the man she'd been chasin' gets to first base
And I just can't escape, I'm in bad shape
You making love to someone else is more than I can take
And so I make all the movement I can to no avail
Scream and yell, sinkin' deeper into my personal Hell

I'm getting heated, I'm sorry, have another coffee
I needed to release my sparrow chest
From just a piece of this pressure
Unless an escape route is found
I'm going down underground
Into lifetimes of pain, it's absurd
The heaviest chain is contained is the sound of one word
So I'm referred back to Hell, huh
Just as well, I hate needles an' get twinges
At the thought of syringes

J, I'm going insane with shame
I dream and watch her makin' love over and over again
With what I call a farmer's swain
Unintelligent, pea-brained retard who's dick is always hard
Oh God, of course I'm jealous, fellows
Oversexed flexing his pec's
Jesus, what's he going make her do next?
I'm mad vex, the way she gently scratches his chest

You used to do that to me back in 1253
Pity me, while you lie with your lover
I stare and suffer in despair while you ruffle his hair
Unaware of who else is there
I move quick, I want to try my trick one last time
You know it's possible to vaguely define my outline
When dust move in the sunshine
So I'm tryin' to change, vibrate myself to near human pitch

Which reminds me how I used to come unstitched
And switch 'round the house in a blind rage
It took years and an ocean of tears
To find the key to this cage
And write another stage into a new age
It's difficult to gauge
But I know that I'll see you again, on that you may depend
I just don't know how or when
Sleep on, my lost love on gone"

1805,ML1806,The Little Willies,Lou Reed,happy,"We were drivin' through West Texas
The land of beef and pork
Where they tend the hides of leather
We wear back in New York
In a pasture, along a roadside
Behind a brokedown shack
On a dusky side of evening
We saw a figure dressed in black

And we don't mean to sound like we're trippin'
But we swear to God
We saw Lou Reed cow tippin
Cow tippin

Hey Lou, ""Is that you?""
She said as we pulled to the shoulder
He just said, ""Go screw.""
And then he turned and tipped one over
Under a spitshine Western sky
The color of blue varnish
Hey it's like Fellini
Actually I'm thinkin' more like Jim Jarmusch

And we can't say how much we've been sippin
But we swear to God
We saw Lou Reed cow tippin
Cow tippin

I got cops on the cell
I said I got a little story to tell
Lou Reed is in the cow pen
They said, Oh no! Not again!

And we hope our perceptions isn't slippin
But we swear to God
We saw Lou Reed cow tippin
Cow tippin

Cow tippin
Cow tippin
Cow tippin
You really think that was Lou Reed?
Cow tippin
I'm sure it was, he was wearing black Levis
Cow tippin
I thought he was a vegetarian
Cow tippin
He's just tippin them over, he wasn't eating them
Cow tippin
Oh
Cow tippin"

We won't stop 'cause we don't know how

We hurt the same, the same black and blue

And the winter wears and tears
Our bones

He's shooting us down
He thinks he's a big man but he doesn't know anything about us or anything at all

At night he lies awake
And his heart aches
'Cause it's cold
He sweats it out all the night through
Then he throws up all over me and you

But anywhere else now seems like a million miles away
And I must have been high to believe that I would ever leave
Now I'm just a flat fine line like the Wichita Skyline

I rode on the airstream across the great lonesome afternoon
I wished hard enough to hurt, drove fast enough to catch the moon
But I must have been dreamin' again 'cause there's nothing around the bend
Except for that flat fine line, the Wichita skyline

As far as Salina I can get that good station from LaRue
I'm searching the dial while I'm Scanning the sky for a patch of blue
And I watch that black clouds roll in chasing me back again
Back to the Flat Fine Line, the Wichita skyline.

Gaze in their eyes as they die
Violence inflicting of pain
Savage morticians deny
Drive the salt in the wound
Arouse the subconscious to lie

There are days every now and again I pretend I'm okay

And having so much to say (Much to say)
And watchin' you walk away (Walk away)

Never knowing what could have been
And not seein' that lovin' you
Is what I was tryin' to do

It's hard to deal with the pain of losing you everywhere I go
But I'm doin' it
It's hard to force that smile when I see our old friends and I'm alone

Still harder gettin' up, gettin' dressed, livin' with this regret
But I know if I could do it over
I would trade, give away all the words that I saved in my heart
That I left unspoken

On display here for the first time in (enter year here)
At the World's fair - but is it really?
Ladies and Gentlemen I propose that the market is sinking
Under the weight of useless contraptions added to the shopping carts of all hard-working families
Electric doodads and wizard hats and such to keep the munchkins entertained
But get replaced by newer versions or just breakdown systematically
Mothers - how many times have you debated self-euthanasia tablets for breakfast snacks
When restlessness attacks seemingly at random?
With an emptiness inside that's hard to identify, maybe
Pursuing habits like pill-popping and constant overeating?
Chances are you've been abandoned

And I'm not a doctor, so I don't know much about medicine
But I'm willing to bet that you, yes you little
What's your name sweetheart? (wawa) yeah, whatever
Get a funny feeling in your tummy when you see mommy cry
Something between woozy and confusion
And you spend your thoughts on how the sadness
In your mommy can be rooted out, burned, scorned, turned out, forgotten
So you can concentrate on candy and little baby dolls or
Whatever it is that normal kids get to think about
Well I can honestly say that this invention is,
Let me start by saying we've grafted only the finest of,
Inserted the most high tech, state of the art, with brain charted for authentic
True to human emotion and trained to be domestic
Made from the most easily available materials and, uh, loosely inspected
Guaranteed to revolutionize

Has led to simulated feelings of resentment and worthlessness

Peace - don't make me laugh!
All I hear is motherfuckers rappin' sucotash
Livin' large, tellin' me to get out the gang
I'm a nigga, gotta live by the trigger
How the fuck do you figure?
That I can say peace and the gunshots will cease?!
Every cop killer goes ignored
They just send another nigga to the morgue
A point scored- they could give a fuck about us
They rather catch us with guns and white powder
If I was old, they'd probably be a friend of me
Since I'm young, they consider me the enemy
They kill ten of me to get the job correct
To serve, protect, and break a niggas neck
'Cause I'm the one with the trunk of funk
And 'Fuck tha Police' in the tape deck
You should listen to me 'cause there's more to see
Call my neighborhood a ghetto 'cause it houses minorities
The other color don't know you can run but not hide
These are tales from the darkside...

You wanna free Africa, I stare at yuh
'Cause we ain't got it too good in America
I can't fuck with them overseas

It was plain and simple
The 9mm went <pop> to the temple
<Pop pop pop> was the sound I put the bitch down
And ran to the schoolyard bathroom
Looked in the trash can yo it had room
So I ducked my ass in it for a minute
Covered with trash I had to lay back
Mad as fuck, thinkin' about the payback
Tonight the crew gonna have a little fun
I went home and cut the barrel of my shotgun
It's gettin' critical - I stole a 5.0
I let it go - drive real slow
I yelled out 'Ice Cube sucka'
The shot-gun kicked - and it murdered motherfuckers
I told you last album
When I got a sawed off, bodies are hauled off
It's a shame, that niggas die young
But to the light side it don't matter none
It'll be a drive by homicide
But to me its just another tale from the darkside...

Verse Three: Chuck D

Standing in the middle of war
In the middle we flex
When we die, we won't make +Jet+
+Ebony+ can't see to the lightside
The term they apply to us is a nigga
Call it what you want, 'cause I'm comin' from the coroner
Sayin' my rhymes with a Ph.D.
Who's black - don't wanna role - sells his soul
Watch his head go rollin'
Who the fuck are they foolin?
Nobody knows, but I suppose the color of my clothes
Matches the color of the one on my face
As they wonder what's under my waist
[Standin on the verge] of them gettin' brown
That's a fact got a fear on their bozack
Run, run, run, their ass off, they can not hide
Yet Cube, they can't fuck with the darkside!"
1825,ML1826,Mastodon,I Am Ahab,angry,"There's magic in the water that attracts
All men (all men)
Across hills and down streams
The turning of the tide

Outlook
Future bright
Selfish
Beauty shines
Light cloud rain drive on

13 years to this day red planet aligned
Into sight 60,000 years of light
Fascination with a mountain put to sea
Built to slay and conquer
All with teeth of beasts"

Work like the devil for my pay
But that lucky old sun got nothin' to do
But roll around heaven all day

Fuss with my woman, toil for my kids
Sweat till I'm wrinkled and gray
While that lucky old sun has nothing to do
But roll around heaven all day

Good Lord up above, can't you know I'm pining
Tears all in my eyes
Send down that cloud with a silver lining
Lift me to paradise

Show me that river, take me across
And wash all my troubles away
Like that lucky old sun, give me nothing to do
But roll around heaven all day

(Good Lord up above, can't you know I'm pining)
(Tears all in my eyes)

Roll around heaven all day

1827,ML1828,Cake,Wheels,happy,"In a wooden boat in the shipping lanes
With the freighters towering over me
I can hear the jets flying overhead
Making lines across the darkening sky
And when the sun is going down I can take a taxi into town
And the waiter at the restaurant sets a table just for me

Wheels keep on spinning round
Spinning round spinning round
Wheels keep on spinning round
Spinning round and round
(All right)

So I had a plane to take me to a place so far away from you
Eventually we began to see that we could be completely free
And I could get away from you
And you could get away from me
And we could live each separately in our cities in the sun

Wheels keep on spinning round
Spinning round spinning round
Wheels keep on spinning round
Spinning round and round
(All right)

In a seedy karaoke bar by the banks of the mighty Bosphorus
Is a Japanese man in a business suit singing ((Platters:Smoke Gets In Your Eyes|Smoke Gets In Your Eyes))
And the muscular cyborg German dudes dance with sexy French Canadians
While the overweight Americans wear their patriotic jumpsuits

Wheels keep on spinning round
Spinning round spinning round
Wheels keep on spinning round
Spinning round and round


Wheels keep on spinning round
Spinning round spinning round
Wheels keep on spinning round
Spinning round and round

The streets are shallow

Before anything

Fireworks went off that night
When alice went home
Dreams exploding in the sky
It's all very strong
There she goes alone, outside
Thinking you and i

The tired toungue
Is leaking stories
From a minds caotic
Map of the passed

Surrender now
You save the clicks and hours
'Cause your sorrow's breaching
In the hours to come

Dreams exploding in the sky

There she goes alone, outside

I believe in Beatles
I believe my little soul has grown

And I'm still so afraid
Yes, I'm still so afraid
Yeah, I'm still so afraid on my own
On my own

What made my life so wonderful?
What made me feel so bad?
I used to wake up the ocean
I used to walk on clouds

If I put faith in medication
If I can smile a crooked smile
If I can talk on television
If I can walk an empty mile

Then I won't feel afraid
No, I won't feel afraid
I won't be, be afraid

Each night and day I pray
And hope that I might find you

It tantalized you with its bait."

The frost christens every car that drives by with ice
And then I know
Those old black and white movies were true

A slow taxi through the twinkling glitz
Takes us past the megastores
The whores, the poor, the rich in the Ritz
Then I know
Those old black and white movies were true

Is there enough change in your pocket
For another gin and tonic?
And a moment when the conscience explodes
The snow upon the bonnet
The picture
The song
The sonnet
The morning light as she puts on her clothes

The steps up out of the subway to the cold
Your cute face, dumb hat, runny nose

Yeah I know
Those old black and white movies were true"

Open my eyes and my path is clearer

Pushing ahead till my goal is nearer

Couldn't my tell my beginning, from the ends
For every door that close, a window opens
And round the world and back again


It starts from within, yeah

I'm excited for the things ahead of me
I've decited I can make it my own
Embrace the good and bad
And let go of the past

1852,ML1853,Jean Grae,My Story,sad,"If I could swim a thousand lakes to bring your life back

I write that, but infinity can't rewind facts

You are divinity
My primitive mind was struggling
Just to understand the meaning of life, forgive me
I never told my mommy, I couldn't break her spirit
She always wished her daughter, extraordinary thinking
So I traveled alone, young, sixteen got in the habit of not stayin' at home
Doing the sad walk like
Bill Bixby, a dollar fifty
Trips to the hospital so that Medicaid could fix me
I couldn't eat shit. I fainted frequent. On cold floors and I pause and I think, keep it
I'm lost, my four friends know
And just fuck at the boys' apartments for rent, so
I'm all wishin' that it's a dream ending soon
I've actually erased a lot that I've been through

()
See when the rain comes down, I know it's fallin' for me, and only for me
And when the pain comes around, there's nowhere else I rather would be
I know what I've done, Please forgive me

Now all my bitter homies sayin' that's what men do
Feelin' retarded for seeing partner potential
On top of that, the doctors telling me a heart murmur
I can't take it; I'm contemplating a Glock burner, a cop murderer
I can't be, this can't be
The tears streaming and I can't see, they lance me
And I'm passin' out, and this is just for blood
They had to cover the mass amounts, I've had enough
And you don't know what it's like in waiting rooms
And outside their picketing pictures could slay you
Their screamin' victims, and spitting till they shame you
I hold my head low and shiver push my way through
They put you in a room, where you can change into
Your gown and shower cap, shaking as a fiend would do
And that's when you think of leaving, fleeing the building and then they call you and you hear the call of your children
They count down from ten now, you wanna stop 'em but you say it in your head, your out for the cut
Then you wake up in another room with plenty others
They call it recovery; you're thinkin' we ain't mothers
And then prescription pills, written a 'scrip with chills
An understatement, you're dressed but you're naked still
And your brain won't think straight
Wait - Can't finish this

()

I kept it bottled up; my parent's found the pills
Screaming God what have you done?
Cried till I snotted blood, then got a gun
My temper ran quick tho, from the thought, then the worst I was caught in the same place
A year later, for me that's when hatred started
My faith martyred, I've dated a father but farther, then I moved on
Years past, the guilt's worse and it builds till your heart' smashed
Then I miscarried 22 age, I was headed to a breakdown
Swallowed up some pills and I laid down
I was a failure at that too, bailed from the rap then but fate took me back in
Sing is a tattoo my fingers attached with
Twenty-seven with three kids that I never met
What if I was Catholic? Wonder if they hate me?
Thinking how their mother could ever murder?
Well take me hell - to the depths where the brimstone chokes me constantly
I am a monster, see
How could I possibly correspond with God when I gave the authority to end that life?
But it's never over, even if we have a child
They coulda had a brother or sister or both
I'm thinking about another life that almost got close
Prayin' that in another time we coulda' changed posts
If I could just reverse time, I would
I don't know what I would do, honestly it's not good
I'm sorry"

Knut's my name and here I float
Out on the sea in a great big boat
And I'm the one who beats the drum in time

To stroke the oars that drive our galleons on
And while we rowed we had our song
And we had our God and it may seem odd
But at least there was a cause

Caught a wind and we upped the sail
Lost two ships when it turned to a gale
Down went a third when she rammed on a whale
Though we despaired we could not fail
And through it all we never faltered

Late at night I lay on the deck
Wondering why I risk my neck
Picture myself in a sinking wreck
And down I'm going not knowing why
I just can't quite recall the reason why

It's such a drag to carry on
But there was a cause, but there was a cause
But there was a reason
Reason
If you like I'll be your Viking

Sit you down to a Nordic meal
Give you strength that you might wield
A Viking sword and a Viking shield
And off well sail in mighty ships of yore
Perhaps we shouldn't let our hands get sore

We need someone to pull the oars
And to do the chores
So we need a cause, we need a reason, reason why"

1856,ML1857,Hagalaz' Runedance,Serenade of The Last Wolf,sad,"He runs into the night,
Finding a place to hide;
Why do they hunt him again?

His heart, it beats so fast;
No sound, they moved on at last.
Timidly he wanders his way.

The outcast, he enters their town,
Senseless hate haunts him now;
The outcast with more feeling then they'll ever know.

He only came for some food,
Maybe even company;
Sometimes he feels so alone.

He is the last one of his kind,
All his companions have died;
Man signed their fatal destiny.

His dreams tell him of ancient times,
Of wolves and men running side by side;
How delightful freedom must have been.

Wild woman's mate and totem-beast,
Idolized he was, but suddenly all changed;
When the men with false dogmas came.

You call him the evil beast?
But you are the real evil beast!
You, who damned nature's dearest child.

He cries his sorrow to the moon,
A tear shines through the misty gloom.
Can't you hear the last wolf's serenade?

They came wild and free,
Life in it's livery,
Stealing life from the land's living.

Alone he sits by the lake,
His image in the lake his only friend.
Can't you hear the last wolf's serenade?

Can't you hear the last wolf's serenade?"

You're chosen for this great mission because we owe you some favors
And besides, you're bright, a little too bright

Open the hatch, launch the war satellite that the commies aren't supposed to know about
Our real challenge is to keep it a secret from the press back home

Especially around us, we like you better when you're far away

We have but that's your problem, we planned it that way
We had to dispose of all of you so we can spoil the final frontier
How dare you question our Star Wars plans for the farce that they are?

In darkness through my being here, away from you

Come Lollard, raise your lute and sing, and to my ears her beauty bring
Like Maddox in the days of old we'll feast and drink until we fold
And folding still we'll spare a thought for what's been lost and what's been caught

I'm so tired and bored of the Mr. Nice Guy
Treats me well, but ""stiff"" is the word on my mind

So send me in the fools
Throw away the heroes
I need some excitement here tonight
Send me in the fools
I'm startin' up the party
I make wakin' up wanna feel a vibe

What I need is something
That's not against the law
It just fit in space and
Baby I'm bored, I'm bored of the feelin'
That safe, easy touch
Need a man to get my engine started up

So tame, too lame, that don't make my kind of man
Find a wild side somewhere and maybe we can

So send me in the fools
Throw away the heroes
I need some excitement here tonight
Send me in the fools
I'm startin' up the party
I make wakin' up wanna feel a vibe

Get me off this one-way road I'm goin' down
All I feel like now is
Heaven's so far

So send me in the fools
Throw away the heroes
I need some excitement here tonight
Send me in the fools
I'm startin' up the party
I make wakin' up wanna feel a vibe

So send me in the fools
Throw away the heroes
I need some excitement here tonight
Send me in the fools
I'm startin' up the party
I make wakin' up wanna feel a vibe

So send me in the fools
Throw away the heroes
I need some excitement here tonight
Send me in the fools
I'm startin' up the party
I make wakin' up wanna feel a vibe"
1873,ML1874,Timo Rautiainen & Trio Niskalaukaus,Lintu,sad,"Tuskin tunnen häntä ja kuitenkin
Tulin häntä tapaamaan
Hän on niin kovin kaunis vieläkin
Kun kääntyy minua katsomaan

Tämä yö on minulle viimeinen
Kuulen hänen sanovan
Olen sairas ja väsynyt ihminen
Ja siksi lähteä haluan

Sinä tiedät jo jotakin elämästä
Jotain tiedän minäkin
Kun vain uskallat lakata pelkäämästä
Paratiisin saat takaisin

Hän vielä jatkaa kyynelet silmissään
Sanaa jokaista painottaen
Hän pitää kättäni tiukasti kädessään
Ja sanoo silmiin katsoen:

En kadu ketään niistä, joita syliini suljin
Heitä sentään rakastin
Itken kaikkia niitä
Joiden ohitse kuljin
Joita väistin ja pakenin

Sillä aina kun ihmisen lähelle päästin
Löysin lähelle itsekin
Mutta jos itseäni
Varjelin ja säästelin
Heti eksyin ja palelin

Hänen katseensa sammuu, hän huokaisee
Hänen otteensa raukeaa
Siinä samassa silmiä häikäisee
Ja huoneen ikkuna aukeaa

Kun jälleen katson häntä, hän muuttunut
Onkin linnuksi edessäin
Ja linnun siipeä puhtaan valkoista
Minä pidänkin kädessäin

Lintu nousee ja lentoon jo lehahtaa
Minä paikalle yksin jään
Hahmo taivaan korkeuksiin loittoaa
Huone humisee tyhjyyttään

Istun hiljaa vielä ja muistelen
Hänen viime sanojaan
Niitä puoliääneen toistelen
Kun hän on mennyt menojaan:

En kadu ketään niistä, joita syliini suljin
Heitä sentään rakastin
Itken kaikkia niitä, joiden ohitse kuljin
Joita väistin ja pakenin

Sillä aina kun ihmisen lähelle päästin
Löysin lähelle itsekin
Mutta jos itseäni varjelin ja säästelin
Heti eksyin ja palelin"

In my veins runs the poison wild
In the streams of mountains I flow
I have opened the doors for unleashed and endless hate
It will burn like the raging green flames
Inside a man dwell secrets so cold

Through the dreadful storms, across the frozen oceans
I have come from the dark lands with sorrow in my hands
The firewind rages in the sky
And my luminous sword hungers for more
I will leave no one alive
For I am the Slayer of Light

I... I will break your will
I... I will crush your faith
I... I will slay your dreams
I will reclaim the stars and I will tear your precious world apart
I will tear it apart

I will pull everything with me under the surface
And all the screams will fade into my dreams
Fall now! Dying light!
I will burn away the ground beneath your feet
And all will be vanished in the darkness
Dying light! Fall now!
And let the night arrive

Through the dreadful storms, across the frozen oceans
I have come from the dark lands with sorrow in my hands
The firewind rages in the sky
And my luminous sword hungers for more
I will leave no one alive

Just hurts like hell
Leaving is my only choice
Will you cry for me?

'Cause all of the men that looked in your eyes
And all of the boys that lie at your feet
Forget how to breathe, forget how to speak
And all of them want you tonight
So hold me tight

Are you still around me, my friends

To state that my young eyelids just turned to grey
And no one minds"

You can't live this life for me

I can't last till night turns to day
I can't find the words to say
It all stops when kingdom comes
And you can't hide in your grave

Suddenly I was free
But you left me without anything
Suddenly I was free
But you shot me full of everything
Now you're all I need

Blue shadows behind your eyes
I wonder who you disguise
Through windows behind the sky
I wonder who you will find

I'm so tired, I can't get back
I'm walking to still connect
With something I had left
But how can you have control

Suddenly I was free
You left me without anything

Natural Born Killers

Let me tell you something; this is the 1990's. Alright?
In this day and age, a man has to have choices
A man has to have a little bit of variety

What are you talking about, variety? Hostages?
You want to fuck some other women, now?
Is that what you're talking about, Mickey?
Why'd you pick me up?
Why'd you take me out of my fucking house and kill my parents with me?
Ain't you committed to me?
Where are we fucking going?

Just relax, alright?
It's me, your lover
Not some demon, not your father
Alright, relax

No, you're not my fucking lover
You're not my fucking
You've been loving me?
You've been fucking loving me? Huh?
You've been loving me real...

I still recall the taste of your tears
Echoing your voice just like the ringing in my ears
My favorite dreams of you still wash ashore
Scraping through my head 'til I don't want to sleep anymore

You make this all go away, you make this all go away
I'm down to just one thing, I'm starting to scare myself
You make this all go away, you make this all go away
I just want something, I just want something I can never have"

And riding for a fall today
I am dressed in style, so eager in mind
But furthermore distracted by you
And it's like I lose myself
In dreaming of summer days in bloom
Oh, I've got no clue how I could fight that
All that I am is worth a dime
Worth a dime


This liquid lunch will not stop my punch-
Drunk quality to doze while I run
It is thirty-nine degrees in my mind
It's thirty thousand miles more to go
'Cause it's like I lose myself
In dreaming of summer days in bloom
For I've got no clue whatever happened
All that I am is worth a dime
Worth a dime"
1884,ML1885,Spike Jones & His City Slickers,Cocktails For Two,happy,"In some secluded rendezvous
That overlooks the avenue
With someone sharing a delightful chat
Of this and that
And cocktails for two

As we enjoy a cigarette
To some exquisite chansonette
Two hands are sure to slyly meet beneath a serviette
With cocktails for two

My head may go reeling
But my heart will be obedient
With intoxicating kisses
For the principal ingredient

Most any afternoon at five
We'll be so glad we're both alive
Then maybe fortune will complete her plan
That all began
With cocktails for two"

I never used to snore in my sleep till this rap shit started
Warm thoughts fill the hot-headed and cold-hearted
Your whole paycheck, you burp it and then fart it
And y'all think I'm gon' stop? BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!
In one year I got rich, now life's movin so fast
But bein broke with no food is just a thing of the past
Plus I'm the new phenomenon like white women with ass
And y'all prayin' that I flop? BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!
In New York I buy clothing, in Cali I get green
In Atlanta I get sleep, in Texas I sip lean
All these rappers wanna know what I'm gettin' for sixteens
Try 80, want a discount? BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!
See in just six months I infiltrated the system
If you find somebody better, then I'm sorry I missed him
Niggaz hate givin' me props 'cause I might use it against them
C'mon, get Ludacris out! BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!

(Chorus 2X: Ludacris)
If you mad I'm on top, then wish me gone
If you mad I'm on the road, then wish me home
And if you mad that I'm right, punk wish me wrong
But after your three wishes - BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!

(Ludacris)
It's time to saddle up the Tontos 'cause I'm the Lone Ranger
I eat dinner with Jews but don't talk to strangers
I'm just a few albums from filling your disc changer
If you ever think of stoppin' me - BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!
I'm a hustler by nature but criminal by law
Any charges set against me, chunk it up and stand tall
Next year I'm lookin' in to buyin Green Briar mall{?}
You probably own a lot of property! BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!
C'mon and take a look, he's got gigantic balls
Plus his money keeps flowin like Niagara Falls
We all know Jesus saves and Ludacris withdraws
I'm 'bout to go on vacation - BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!
Shout out to Bill O'Reilly, I'ma throw you a curve
You mad 'cause I'm a THIEF and got away with words
I'ma start my own beverage, it'll calm your nerves
Pepsi's the New Generation - BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!

(Ludacris)
My black people show me love when I'm up on the block
And Latinos always waitin for my CD's to drop
White people love the flow, they say, ""Dude, you fuckin' rock!""
Yo' fans are my fans, right? BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!
So find my album in the stores and look for the white steam
Rip it open, play it and yo' momma might scream
It's hard, other albums are softer than ice cream
Yo' scans are my scans, right? BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!
Now Luda's throwin' up A's, and I'm lightin up L's
Around the globe gettin' paid, you home bitin yo' nails
DTP, the only label that practice fightin ourselves
We probably gettin' on your nerves, huh? BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!
I been eatin and gettin' FAT while y'all dyin' of hunger
I get drunk in the winter, stay high in the summer
Watch out, my album's puttin' up McDonald's numbers
You over 6 million served, huh? BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!

Blow it out ya ass!

Je rêvais enfant
De vivre libre comme un gitan

Je voyais des plages
De sable noir
Où couraient des chevaux sauvages

Et je dessinais dans mes cahiers
Les sentiers secrets
Des montagnes d'Espagne

Gitan,
Quand plus tard
J'apprenais mes premiers accords de guitare

Sur les routes je partais sans bagages
En rêvant
D'autres paysages

Où je suivais les gens du voyages
Dans leurs caravanes
Au son des violons tziganes

(refrain)
Vivre ma vie comme un gitan
Avoir la musique dans le sang
Et pour l'amour n'avoir dans la peau
Qu'une seule femme à la fois

Vivre ma vie comme un gitan
Vivre ma vie comme je l'entends
Avoir la liberté pour drapeau
""Sans foi ni loi"" pour credo

Gitan
Je le suis et le resterai
Le temps de mon vivant

Mes guitares sont d'Amérique
Et mes paysages
De grands espaces blancs

Où je roule dans ma caravane
En éternel exil
Dans la jungle des villes

Vivre ma vie comme un gitan
Avoir la musique dans le sang

Follow me now to the vault down below
Drinking the wine as we laugh at the time
Which is passing incredibly slow

(What are these chains binding my arms)
Part of you dies each passing day
(Say it's a game and I'll come to no harm)
You'll feel your life slipping away

You who are rich and whose troubles are few
May come around to see my point of view
What price the crown of a King on his throne
When you're chained in the dark all alone

(Spare me my life only name your reward)
Part of you dies each brick I lay
(Bring back some light in the name of the Lord)
You'll feel your mind slipping away"

Workin all week
Nine to five for my money
So, when the weekend comes
I go get live with the honey
Rollin down the street
I saw this girl and she was pumpin
I winked my eye, she got into the ride
Went to a club, we're jumpin
Introduced myself as Loc
She said, ""You're a liar"" 
I said, ""I got it goin on baby doll,
and I'm on fire""
Took her to the hotel
She said, ""You're the king""
I said, ""Be my queen, if you know what I mean,
and let us do the wild thing""

Wild thing

Shoppin at the mall
Lookin for some gear to buy
I saw this girl, she cool rocked my world
And I had to adjust my fly
She looked at me and smiled and said,
""You have plans for the night?""
I said, ""Hopefully if things go well
I'll be with you tonight""
So, we journeyed to her house
One thing led to another
I keyed the door, I cold hit the floor
Looked up and it was her mother
I didn't know what to say
I was hanging by a string
She said, ""Hey you two, I was once like you
and I liked to do the wild thing""

Wild thing
She loved to do the wild thing
Wild thing
Please baby baby please

Posse in effect
Hangin out is always hype 
And when me and the crew leave a shindig
I want a girl who's just my type
Saw this luscious little frame
I ain't lyin fellas, she was fine
The sweet young miss cold gave me a kiss
And I knew that she was mine
Took her to the limousine
It's still parked outside
I tipped the chauffeur when it was over
And I gave her my own ride
Couldn't get her off my jock
She was like static cling
But that's what happens when body start slappin
From doin the wild thing

Wild thing
She wanna do the wild thing
Please baby baby please

Wild thing

Doin a little show
At the local discotheque
This fine young chick was on my jock
So, I said, ""what the heck?""
She wanted to come on stage
And do her little dance
So, I said chill for now
But maybe later you'll get your chance
So, when the show was finished
I took her around the way
And what do you know she was good to go
Without a word to say 
We was all alone and she said, 
""Tone let me tell you one thing 
I need fifty dollars to make you holler
I get paid to do the wild thing""

Say what?
Yo, love you must be kiddin
You're walkin, babe
Just break outta here 
Hasta la vista, baby

Wild thing"

Think he even did a little time in the slammer

Her daddy came out wavin' that twelve gauge
We tore out the drive he peppered my tailgate
What was I thinkin'?

Oh, I knew there'd be hell to pay
But that crossed my mind a little too late...
'Cause I was...

Thinkin' 'bout a little white tank top sittin' right
There in the middle by me
I was thinkin' 'bout a long kiss man just gotta get
Goin' where a night might lead
I know what I was feelin'
But what was I thinkin'... what was I thinkin'

By the county line the cops were nippin' on our heels
Pulled off the road and kicked it in four-wheel
Shut off the lights and tore through the corn field
What was I thinkin'?

Out the other side she was hollerin' faster
Took a dirt road and had the radio blastin'
Hit the honky tonk for a little close dancin'
What was I thinkin'?

Oh, I knew there'd be hell to pay
But that crossed my mind a little too late...
'Cause I was...

Thinkin' 'bout a little white tank top sittin' right

Goin' where a night might lead
I know what I was feelin'
But what was I thinkin'... what was I thinkin'

When a mountain of a man with a ""born to kill"" tattoo
Tried to cut in I knocked out his front tooth
We ran outside hood-slidin' like Bo Duke
What was I thinkin'?

I finally got her home at a half past too late
Her daddy's in a lawn chair sittin' on the driveway
Put it in park as he started my way
What was I thinkin', oh what was I thinkin'

Then she gave a come-and-get-me grin
And like a bullet we were gone again... 'cause I was

Thinkin' 'bout a little white tank top sittin' right

Gather round the home she rests

My open eyes to lightning storm
The touch of mist felt soft, felt warm
On my face

The star that I just don't see

And if I am a reflection of him then I must be fly because
His light it shines so bright I wouldn't lie

I found myself immediately intrigued by him
It's almost like I knew this man from another life
Like back then maybe I was his husband maybe he was my wife
And even, things I don't like about him are fine with me
'Cause it's not hard for me to understand him 'cause he's so much like me
And it's truly my pleasure to share his company
And I know that it's God's gift to breathe
The air he breathes

'Cause he is the truth
Said he is so real

It's unconditional

You know what I'm talking about-(Spoken)
That's the way I feel
And I always will-(Spoken)

See the twisted hand of doubt seal the affair
The insect trust

Your body a vehicle to house his disease

Pearls before swine they are nothing but blind
Submit to nothing and swallow my spit of scorn
Invisible king

Procession of woe, struck down by sorrow
A burden so great weighs heavy on old and withered beliefs

Tryin' to match what we had and now I...

I was hopin' we could find a way
To have what we had again today
Though it's been some time since you and I...
It wouldn't hurt to try
To find our love

Wish that I, would have known the treasures I'd found
I didn't know, until you left, I loved your smile...
Just the other day, your girl said you can't stand me...
I know you don't mean that can't we
Just slow down a minute and talk it out
I've been, in my share, of love since then
Don't know about, what you've been through
But nothin' compares... to
What we had
All I know is I need you back
And I know that you need me back
Baby let's try again to find our love oh

And I can't for-get... the times we shared
Didn't know love until love was gone
Till I moved on,
Now I'm right back to square one again

Looking for a peace at the end of the line
Sometimes I can't help myself feel the tide
I'm all at sea and so unwise

I'm so afraid I'd lose your love as time goes by
But courage is a fire and a beacon so bright
The sunset builds a memory - our love signed
And all I see becomes a lie

	Will I wash away, turning like a stone?
	I need a place where I belong
	Call the setting sun to throw me down the road
	And take me to a place called home!

I close my eyes, I know you're there, love of mine
Standing on the shore in a world I designed
The sunset fires a lonely flare into the sky
And all I see we say goodbye

But a six week vacation from the use of my right arm? 
It was just the two hits and I remember nothing more
Only Alex hitting the switch and me hitting the floor
We're taking this lying down
The one thing I can stand up for is resting supine on the ground
Mr. McDermott, won't you help me to my feet? 
Because the drumline's going wild in the San Francisco streets

The long walk home, an hour and a half
But quickly turns to three or four with stops at every underpass
But by June 22nd, I have done the math
And it's a hundred and five liters I'll consume of Dr. Path
Some girls will tell their secrets to anyone
The word ""love"" gets thrown around a lot near graduation
So please don't whisper sweet nothings in my ear 
When the sound of shredding vocal chords is what I want to hear
Because we're going to San Francisco 
And I forget to wear some flowers in my hair

She's got a secret surname that nobody knows
With the most gorgeous hyphen
You wouldn't believe the way it glows
And I'm the only one who gets to see it way up close
So the rest of you can stick it up your nose

Last night, I had the strangest dream that I have ever known 
My mother, in a fit of rage, chases me from our home
My mother, the murderer holds me down in the road
She's got the nail clippers at my throat

Now even though things lately may have been real horrorshow
I'm wishing I was back in utero
I'd like to go back to the way that things were before
But apparently, I'm looking at physical therapy
It won't be exactly how it used to be
It ain't hard to see that it's not that way
Not that way anymore
Jesus Christ is suffering upon his cross tonight
I just sit outside waiting for frost to bite
""It's always this way,"" 
She says on her way out the door
Just wait and see
The rest is yet to reveal itself to me"

And prying eyes, they stoop too low
Poisoning my soul, as sanity waits in the gallows

Defeated I, fighting for a lost cause
Depleted I, dying for the wrong cause

These are the hours on the range
The more you show them
The more they choose to take away
Some things never change in the wings
And as it's your war,
There'll be no escape at all"

It's rags to riches
Over there

And the walls came
Tumbling down

Tear it down

Oh, promised land  (Oh, promised land)

I throw some clothes on in the dark
The smell of cold, car seat is freezing
The world is sleeping, I am numb

Up the stairs to her apartment
She is balled up on the couch
Her mom and dad went down to Charlotte
They're not home to find us out

And we drive
Now that I have found someone
I'm feeling more alone
Than I ever have before

She's a brick and I'm drownin' slowly
Off the coast and I'm headed nowhere
She's a brick and I'm drownin' slowly

They call her name at seven-thirty
I pace around the parking lot
And I walk down to buy her flowers
And sell some gifts that I got

Can't you see
It's not me you're dying for
Now she's feeling more alone
Than she ever has before

She's a brick and I'm drownin' slowly
Off the coast and I'm headed nowhere
She's a brick and I'm drownin' slowly

As weeks went by, it showed that she was not fine
They told me, ""Son, it's time to tell the truth.""
And she broke down and I broke down
'Cause I was tired of lying

Driving back to her apartment
For the moment, we're alone
Yeah, she's alone and I'm alone
Now I know it

Off the coast and I'm headed nowhere
She's a brick and I'm drownin' slowly"

Just come forget this to forget the ""?"" hun the forests prey
Yeah no no ...yeah eey...

Sun goes down
Sun goes down
Sun goes down, Sun goes down

Open your eyes 'cause another day is dawning,
Children of the moon, can you hear them all calling?
Skies open up and an angel starts falling,
Listen to their beats, can you hear them hollering?

Stop in the morning, through to the evening
Dance like you're the only one around
Move like you want it
Move like you need it,
Dancing it up till the sun goes down!

As quietly as a mouse I haunt these halls
I'm just a ghost in this house

That once burned out of control
It took my body and soul
I'm just a ghost in this house

I don't care if it rains
I don't care if it's clear
I don't mind staying in
There's another ghost here
She sits down in your chair
And she shines with your light
And she lays down her head
On your pillow at night

I'm just a ghost in this house
I'm just a shell of the man I was
A living proof of the damage heartbreak does
I'm just a ghost in this house

Following a stronger will in vain

Fast täglich mit der U-Bahn Richtung Tegel.

(gesprochen:)Tegel ist ja nun ein Stadtteil von Berlin, aber da wir heute Abend in Düsseldorf sind, könnte man das Lied auch wie folgt einleiten:

Ich muß heut mit der U-Bahn noch nach Pempelfort,
Ich habe nämlich noch ein wenig Krempel dort.
Dadurch hab' ich kaum noch was in mein 'm Sparschwein,
Denn drei Mark zwanzig kost' mich hier der Fahrschein.

Ich könnte ja mal schwarz fahr'n,
Dann spar' ich den Betrag.
Doch das kostet, hab' ich Pech,
Statt 3 Mark 20 sechzig Mark.

Egal, das eine Mal!
Was soll passier'n?
Die kontrollieren
Heute dich ganz sicher nicht!
Also was zögerst du?

Ich trau mich nich'!
Ich trau mich nich'!

Was soll ich sagen? Ich bin Schwarzfahr-Drückeberger,
Und mein Ärger wird darüber immer ärger.
Na ja, was soll's? Werd' ich halt arm, doch bleib' ich edel.
Da bemerk' ich, neben mir steht ein Mädel.

Was für eine Traumfrau!
Eine wie sie sah ich noch nie!
Ich schau sie an, doch kaum schaut
Sie zurück, krieg' ich weiche Knie...

Geh ran, Mann! Sprich sie an!
Was soll passier'n?
Nix zu verlier'n!
So 'ne Schönheit
Gibt's weit und breit
Nicht zweimal!

Ich trau mich nich'!
Ich trau mich nich'!
Es ist ein Trauma, ich
Trau mich nich'!

Oh nein! Jetzt steigt sie ein
In die U-Bahn gegenüber,
Die in die verkehrte Richtung fährt!
Ich seh' sie wohl nie wieder.

Der U-Bahn-Schacht verschluckt die Bahn,
Au revoir, mon amour fou!
Doch was ist das? Sie guckt mich an
Und lächelt mir zu...

Wie dem auch sei, die Zeit heilt alle Wunden.
Jahre später hab' selbst ich 'ne Frau gefunden.
Und auf einmal steh' ich eh' ich mich versehe,
Mit jener Frau halt da vor'm Traualtar zwecks Ehe.

Der Pfarrer fragt: ""Willst du
Diese hier zum Weibe,
Sie ehren und begehren,
Bis dass der Tod euch scheide?""

Was? So lange?
Na Mann, das kann ja dauern!
Äh, ich schau dann mir
Lieber die Frau
Nochmal kurz genau an...

Ich trau' mich nich'!
Ich trau mich nich' mich zu trauen.
Ich trau mich nich',
Vor allem bei und mit Frauen.

So kann's nicht weitergehen!
Ich bin ein völlig feiger Wurm!
Ich komm' damit nicht mehr klar!
Ich stürz' mich vom Fernsehturm!

Jetzt steh' ich hier, tief unter mir
Klafft der eklatante
Abgrund. Steil geht's runter hier!
Ich wanke bis zur Kante...

<So, meine Damen und Herren, das Lied hat jetzt noch genau eine Strophe. Das ist die Schlimmste von allen. Ich weiß ja nicht, soll ich die wirklich vorsingen heute Abend?

In the poop section of my local record store
Ruben or clay, oh which should I pick

And when I want something even more fruity and fake
I look up 'N' for N'Sync or 'T' for Timberlake
So many skills Justin's making a buck at
Does he rap? Does he sing? He doesn't know what to suck at

Eyes of the heart melted away and found the light.
These are the days of endless dreaming;
Troubles of life are floating away like a bird in flight.

These are the days,

Believin' that the tears would end for good.

The writing on the wall
A Lazarus in parable

A dark and sullen lullaby
Whispered softly as you die
Promising torments are nigh

Danger warning levels hissed out loud
I saw the silver lining hidden in a mushroom cloud
Now I'm reeling from the shock at ground zero

If yesterday you would have stood up proud
Then why tonight have you thrown in with the stoning crowd?
I'll breathe through the foetus of a new day kicking...

The foetus of a new day kicking

It's true that Jesus cannot save
I'm rising from the grave
To put my double cross to shame

A poison rush, a heart attack
A white assassin painted black
You'll fear this reaper coming back

Danger warning levels hissed out loud
I saw the silver lining hidden in a mushroom cloud
Now I'm reeling from the shock at ground zero

If yesterday you would have stood up proud
Then why tonight have you thrown in with the stoning crowd?
I'll breathe through the foetus of a new day kicking...

On a night like this
You laid the serpent's kiss
In this garden of Gethsemane
You played the traitor well...

In a dawn to come
I will blind the sun
To grant you pardon as my enemy

Before damning you to hell..."

Two broken strings, attracted,
To groom my face in life and doom

Hesitate to throw a coin in,
A wish could be a bad thing,
My mouth is just a mush of drool

Standing on the bridge I
Wink at you from up high
A talking fish comes as she moves

I want to be like water
And never need a doctor
And carve the earth without my tools

Do it all

All the things that I relate to well,
Like authors and painters
Transparent paper wings
That float above me while I sleep
To make the room more natural
So we could die in it and die in it and die

The color after sunset
You'd do anything to jinx it,
It'll crush your sculpture just like a willow,
He doesn't need a house
His shoes will walk for miles
There's a gypsy's face make on my pillow.

I want to be like water and slip into your throat
And make you feel alive and good

I want to be like water and never have a doubt and
Reflect what is around my pool

Do it all

All the things that I relate to them
Like authors and painters,
Transparent paper wings
That float above me while I sleep
To make the room more natural
So we could die in it and die in it and die.

And all the dreams that I awake to read like ghostly paintings
And all the things I hate, I wish I didn't have to hate
To find a room that's natural
To live and die in it, live and die, live and die.

I don't think you know just what you're doing
You pretend to know exactly all the things you keep on moving
Said I don't think I know exactly what I'm doing
But I tend to know exactly all the things you keep on moving

When you wake up from your snoozin'
I'll tell you how to do it my way
I'll tell you what I'm doin'
There's a knife up in the drawer

Anybody try to stop it
And I'll find out where you're stompin'
And it's all about the days you spend
Without me at our home."

She sings to the moon and the stars in the sky
Shining from high above you shouldn't ask why

She is the one that you'll never forget
She is the heaven sent angel you met
Oh she must be the reason why god made a girl
She is so pretty all over the world

She puts the rhythm, the beat in the drum
She comes in the morning, in the evening she's gone
Every little hour, every second you live
Trust in eternity, that's what she gives

She looks like Marilyn, walks like Susanne
She talks like Monica and Mary-Ann
She wins in everything that she might do
And she will respect you, forever just you

She is the one that you'll never forget

There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting

What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's chokin' how, everybody's jokin' now
The clocks runs out, time's up, over, blow

Snap back to reality, oh, there goes gravity, oh
There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't
Give up that easy no, he won't have it he knows
His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter he's dope

He knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant he knows
When he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again yo, this whole rhapsody
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go

His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking, make me king
As we move toward a new world order
A normal life is boring, but super-stardom's

Close to postmortem, it only grows harder
Only grows hotter, he blows us all over
These hoes is all on him, coast to coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads God only knows

He's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home, and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose, 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product

They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose dove and sold nada, so the soap opera
Is told and unfolds, I suppose it's old partna'

Tear this motherfuckin' roof off, like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage

But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cipher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine to five

And I can't provide the right type of
Life for my family, 'cause man these goddamn
Food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life

And these times are so hard, and it's getting even harder
Tryin' to feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a Prima Donna
Baby mama drama screamin' on and too much for me to wanna

Stay in one spot, another day of monotony
Has gotten me to the point I'm like a snail I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not

Mom I love you, but this trailer's got to go
I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot, feet fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got
