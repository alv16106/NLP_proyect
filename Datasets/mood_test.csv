0,ML1,George Michael,I Want Your Sex,happy,"There's things that you guess
And things that you know
There's boys that you can trust
And girls that you don't

There's little things you hide
And little things that you show
Sometimes you think you're gonna get it
But you don't and that's just the way it goes

I swear I won't tease you
Won't tell you no lies
I don't need no bible
Just look in my eyes

I've waited so long baby
Now that we're friends
Every man's got his patience
And here's where mine ends

I want your sex
I want your love
I want your sex
I want your... sex

It's playing on my mind
It's dancing on my soul
It's taken so much time
So why don't you just let me go

I'd really like to try
Oh, I'd really love to know
When you tell me you're gonna regret it
Then I tell you that I love you but you still say NO

I swear I won't tease you
Won't tell you no lies
I don't need no bible
Just look in my eyes

I've waited so long baby
Out in the cold
I can't take much more girl
I'm losing control

I want your sex
I want your love
I want your sex
I want your... sex

It's natural
It's chemical (Let's do it)
It's logical
Habitual (Can we do it?)

It's sensual
But most of all...
Sex is something that we should do
Sex is something for me and you

Sex is natural, sex is good
Not everybody does it
But everybody should
Sex is natural, sex is fun
Sex is best when it's... one on one
One on one

I'm not your father
I'm not your brother
Talk to your sister
I am a lover

C-c-c-c-come on

What's your definition of dirty baby
What do you consider pornography
Don't you know I love it till it hurts me baby
Don't you think it's time you had sex with me

What's your definition of dirty baby
What do you call pornography
Don't you know I love it till it hurts me baby
Don't you think it's time you had sex with me

Sex with me
Sex with me
Have sex with me

C-c-c-c-come on"
10,ML11,The Clientele,Impossible,relaxed,"There's a place that we can go at the end of a long, slow day
Street lamps fuse the rising night, I feel so far away
When you came in late from the garden, I couldn't turn my eyes
And I was dead

Outside in the crowded places, ships are sailing through the wood
Impossible
Leaving in the space between the Bovis homes, the railway heath
Impossible

I can see my freedom but I need a little time
Your hair wet and your arms full
You were dead, you were alive
Looking in the heart of light, looking into the silence

From those nights so frigid
They seemed hardly real
Through the last light on the plain
Roland to the dark tower came

Impossible
Impossible
Impossible"

See the spark and the bang,
Nigga shit ain't a game
Do the math or get blast
Bullets go through the glass

And the leather seat sittin' Ave.
It's not a war when there's casualties on one side

Millennium mac man
Clips on the whips I ride in em
Bad bitches I ride inn em
Don't worry I'll get 'em
Gat Jammed or un-jammed
God dam Safest the safety don't work
Squeeze the eagle, it chirp.
End up faced down in the dirt
More than hurt,
Bring the beef where you hang out,
Bang out,
Shots ring out.
Hit your shoulders tryin' to blow your brains out.
Hit your homies in their legs,
Bet they have their canes out tomorrow
You know tomorrow's just a day away,
If you can keep your heart beatin' then your ass awake.

17,ML18,Avenged Sevenfold,Coming Home,angry,"I've been away, searching for a reason
Another purpose to find
I've sailed the seas, fought my many demons
I've looked to gods in the skies

I've stood in Hell, where many had to suffer
I stabbed the Devil in the eyes
Walked many roads to witness ancient idols
And found the great Gates of Fire

Had many storms question my conviction
Gave armies reason to rise
The Hangman's searching for bones he can borrow
While I escaped in the night!
Final plight!

Live again; I won't sin!
I'll be coming home
Tend your light, cause on this night
I'll be coming home

Escape the hell of capitulated mortals
And drink the blood of a king
A desert rain has washed away direction
Had angels looking after me so it seems

Live again; I won't sin!
I'll be coming home
Tend your light, cause on this night
I'll be coming home

My story ends not far from where it started
My weary limbs have grown old
I've seen the world through the eyes of a nomad
Home is where the heart is, I've been told
So I go!

Live again; I won't sin!
I'll be coming home
Tend your light, cause on this night
I'll be coming home

I'm coming home
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
I'm coming home"
18,ML19,Avril Lavigne,How Does It Feel,sad,"I'm not afraid of anything 
I just need to know that I can breathe 
I don't need much of anything 
But suddenly, suddenly 
I am small and the world is big 
All around me is fast moving 
Surrounded by so many things 
Suddenly, suddenly 

How does it feel 
To be different from me? 
Are we the same? 
How does it feel 
To be different from me? 
Are we the same? 
How does it feel? 

I am young and I am free 
But I get tired and I get weak 
I get lost and I can't sleep 
But suddenly, suddenly 

How does it feel 
To be different from me? 
Are we the same? 
How does it feel 
To be different from me? 
Are we the same? 
How does it feel? 

Would you comfort me? 
Would you cry with me? 

I am small and the world is big 
But I am not afraid of anything 

How does it feel 
To be different from me? 
Are we the same? 
How does it feel 
To be different from me? 
Are we the same? 
How does it feel? 

How does it feel, how does it feel 
You're different from me, different"
27,ML28,Opeth,By the Pain I See in Others,sad,"Let me taste
Let me feel
I need to know what you keep inside
No need to speak
Just let it be
Carry out this wish for me let nothing interfere

Rise to submission
I'm still beneath in the soil

Discard your clothes
Let loose you hair
We're intertwined forever and have always been
Say the word
And I'll depart
Upon your lips dwells nothing but the meaning of my cause

Rise to submission
I'm still beneath in the soil

And so comes the dark
Vibrant as ever before
Flowers already withered
In this endless winter of souls

Outside in the park
The days move along
And nothing ever changes
They have nothing on us
And we've always knew
That nothing ever changes

Rise to submission
I'm still beneath in the soil
This is ours alone
Feeding off the warmth
Lured out from inside

Depending on the life blood

Rise to submission
I'm still beneath in the soil
This is ours alone
Feeding off the warmth
Lured out from inside

Silently
Whispering
Move in me and set me free

29,ML30,Iron Maiden,Aces High,angry,"There goes the siren that warns of the air raid
Then comes the sound of the guns sending flak
Out for the scramble we've got to get airborne
Got to get up for the coming attack

Jump in the cockpit and start up the engines
Remove all the wheelblocks there's no time to waste
Gathering speed as we head down the runway
Got to get airborne before it's too late

Running, scrambling, flying
Rolling, turning, diving, going in again
Running, scrambling, flying
Rolling, turning, diving
Run, live to fly, fly to live, do or die
Won't you run, live to fly, fly to live, aces high

Move in to fire at the mainstream of bombers
Let off a sharp burst and then turn away
Roll over, spin round to come in behind them
Move to their blindsides and firing again

Bandits at 8 o'clock move in behind us
Ten ME-109's out of the sun
Ascending and turning our Spitfires to face them
Heading straight for them I press down my guns

Rolling, turning, diving
Rolling, turning, diving, going in again
Rolling, turning, diving
Rolling, turning, diving
Run, live to fly, fly to live, do or die
Won't you run, live to fly, fly to live, aces high"
52,ML53,Rascal Flatts,Summer Nights,happy,"Come on ladies
It's time to pop that top
And fellas, I know you're ready to rock
We went crazy cooped all winter long
And school is out, so let's get it on
Flip flop tans and some white sand
I know the perfect spot

Well the sunset better set soon
So we can get in the mood

Let that igloo cooler mark your piece of paradise

Ooh, oh yeah.

Now fellas, you better watch your step
Don't let them teeny French bikinis

Cause everything about you makes me wanna scream

Here comes the moon, yeah

Whoa
Ooh

It's a party down,
Probably big bar fight on the beach
It's Coronas in Daytona y'all
Well it's wild and it's free

Everybody's feeling sexy

55,ML56,Dr. Dog,The Breeze,relaxed,"Are you moving much too fast?
And the good times that just don't last
If you're always on the go
Make an angel in the snow
And freeze

Do you feel like you're stuck in time?
Forever waiting on that line
If nothing ever moves
Put that needle to the groove
And sing

Is it a dream keeping you awake?
Is it the stillness that makes you shake?
If you need to know for sure
What's on the ocean's floor
You'll sink

Do you like things the way they seem?
Or are you looking behind the scenes?
Well, if you've gotta know
What it takes to make it so
Just believe

Are there dark parts to your mind?
Hidden secrets left behind?
Where no one ever goes
But everybody knows
It's all right

Do you get dizzy on the ground?
It must be something going 'round
What blows us here today
It'll blow us all away,
The breeze
Ah, will blow us all away
The breeze
Ah, will blow us all away
The breeze"

Right through the very heart of it

I want to wake up in a city
That doesn't sleep
And find I'm king of the hill
Top of the heap

These little town blues
Are melting away
I'll make a brand new start of it
In old New York
If I can make it there
I'll make it anywhere

He's well dressed not funny
And not to say in most conversations

Boys will laugh at girls when they're not funny

Paper or plastic,
Don't matter she'll have it
Vacations and shopping sprees these are a few of her favorite things
She'll get what she wants if she's willing to please
His type of girl always comes with a fee
Hey now there's nothing for free

Girls don't like boys, girls like cars and money
Boys will laugh at girls when they're not funny

84,ML85,The Jam,Bricks And Mortar,angry,"Bricks and mortar, reflecting social change,
Cracks in the pavement, reveal cravings for success
Why do we try to hide our past
By pulling down houses and build car parks
Windows and mirrors like a two-way glass
This is progress, nothing stands in its path

Yellow bulldozers, the donkey jackets and J.C.B.'s
While hundreds are homeless they're constructing a parking space

Why do they have to knock them down
And leave the site dormant for months on end?
Who has the right to make that choice?
A man whose home has cost forty grand

Tell me!

Bricks and mortar, bricks and mortar
Knock 'em down!"
85,ML86,Symphony X,The Divine Wings Of Tragedy,sad,"I. AT THE FOUR CORNERS OF THE EARTH (lyrics: Romeo, Pinnela)

On the edge of paradise
Tears of woe fall, cold as ice
Hear my cry
Renounce, have you, thy name
Eternal is my pain

Eternal is the pain that leads me to the thrones of temptation
Eternal is the pain that leads me to the thrones of temptation
Eternal is my pain that leads me to the thrones of temptation

II, IN THE ROOM OF THRONES (instrumental)

III. A GATHERING OF ANGELS (lyrics: Michael Romeo)

There was a time
When nine choirs sang the endless melody of light
Music of the spheres

There was a place
Where mortals embraced thunder and majesty
Their fate lay in our hands

Feel my wings slowly fading (ooh)
Forever lost in time (ooh)
I cry (ooh)

IV. THE WRATH DIVINE (lyrics: Michael Romeo, Thomas Miller)

The burning conflict I'm feeling
It summons me to descend into the other side
And just beyond the stars blazing
A beam light from a red, velvet moon illuminates me

I will devise
From perfect skies, a dark and vengeful day
Faith and mercy gone astray

With strength of infinite measure
The mighty sword divides order from chaos in the kingdom below
And from the mansions of glory
This empty soul cries out one final plea - the end has begun

Our worlds collide
Now in disguise you'll feel the Wrath Divine
Tears of woe fall from the sky

V, THE PROPHET'S CRY (lyrics: Michael Romeo)

The prophet cries
Vast battalions rage on in the sky
Rising from the north - the bringer of war
Eve of destruction
Summon all who have power over fire
Impending doom from shore to shore

Standing on the edge of paradise
I sacrifice my truth and loyalty
Seven deadly sins consume you all, a dance with death
I taste the victory

Rising from the north - the warrior prince (Eternal is the pain that leads me to temptation)
Judgement without compassion eyes of fear
Like the river styx, the gates of hell (Eternal is the pain that leads me to temptation)
""Abandon hope all ye who enter here""

The prophets cry
As armies fall from the edge of the sky
The Prince of truth, now the bringer of war

The day of wrath
Banish all kings from the face of the land
Dominion for strength is my name

VI. BRINGER OF THE APOCALYPSE (instrumental)
I. Eve of Sacrifice
Ii. Armies in the Sky

VII. PARADISE REGAINED (lyrics: Russel Allen, Michael Pinnella)

Looking out on a blue sky
I can see a new world arising
Like a prisoner unbound
I feel the power and the majesty again

Looking up to the heavens
I can see what I've left behind
Beneath the stars, moon and warm sun
And all I know is my paradise has begun"

90,ML91,The Ataris,The Boys Of Summer,happy,"Nobody on the road
Nobody on the beach
I feel it in the air
The summer's out of reach
Empty lake, empty streets
The sun goes down alone
I'm drivin' by your house
Though I know you're not at home

I can see you
Your brown skin shinin' in the sun
You got your hair combed back and your sunglasses on, baby
And I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone

I never will forget those nights
I wonder if it was a dream
Remember how you made me crazy?
Remember how I made you scream?
I don't understand what happened to our love
But baby when I get you back
I'm gonna show you what I'm made of

I can see you
Your brown skin shinin' in the sun
I see you walkin' real slow and you're smilin' at everyone
I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone

Out on the road today
I saw a BLACK FLAG sticker on a Cadillac
A little voice inside my head said, ""Don't look back, You can never look back.""
I thought I knew what love was
What did I know?
Those days are gone forever
I should just let them go but

I can see you
Your brown skin shinin' in the sun
You got that top pulled down and that radio on, baby
And I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone

I can see you
Your brown skin shinin' in the sun
You got that hair slicked back and those Wayfarers on, baby
I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone"

'Cause they know I'm coming straight back home to you, and they know I'm a constant fool for you - so I'm putting my things on a U-haul and I'm blockin out your number when you call

No conversation you can keep your words, cause 90% I done already heard, how long did you think that I would sit here for, I'm letting you know it's not exceptional

No conversation you can save the games, and anything you say I will remain the same. How long did you think that I would sit here for, destroying my soul, it ain't exceptional

I can't believe you even tried to blame me, 'cause you're the one who changed I've been the same me

And I been by your side like a 2 way and like a pager with no clamp that's how you lose me

So my friends come to help me get over you - 'cause they're sick and tired of seeing what I'm going through

I put all of my things on a U-haul and I won't accept at all whenever you call.

No conversation you can keep your words, cause 90% I done already heard, how long did you think that I would sit here for, I'm letting you know it's not exceptional

No conversation you can save the games, and anything you say I will remain the same. How long did you think that I would sit here for, destroying my soul, it ain't exceptional

I should have left your ass long time ago, I was too scared to be out on my own

You made me feel there was no other way

And I won't find love I would be lonely -- ??

You made me feel so damn low

Now take a look at what's happening, this is tragic like when Michael left the Jackson's, I told you you should be careful what you're askin'

You wished I would have left you with some quiet time, but now you got more time than anytime

I know you never thought that I could jet out, but I left before you could tell me get out

No conversation you can keep your words, 90% I done already heard, how long did you think that I would sit here for, I'm letting you know it's not exceptional

No conversation you can save the games, and anything you say I will remain the same. How long did you think that I would sit here for, destroying my soul, it ain't exceptional"

In just a year or two.
And if the sky falls down like pouring rain,
Then I'll be here with you.
I'll go down with you.

Well I'm gonna try for all I'm worth,
To stay with you till the end of the earth.
Don't let me down,
Don't let your feelings win.
Don't give out, and don't give in,
Don't think about tomorrow.

94,ML95,Steve Goodman,My Old Man,sad,"I miss my old man tonight
And I wish he was here with me
With his corny jokes and his cheap cigars
He could look you in the eye and sell you a car
That's not an easy thing to do
But no one ever knew a more charming creature
On this earth than my old man

He was a pilot in the big war in the U.S. Army Air Corps
In a C-47 with a heavy load
Full of combat cargo for the Burma Road
And after they dropped the bomb
He came home and married mom
And not long after that
He was my old man

And oh the fights we had
When my brother and I got him mad
He'd get all boiled up and he'd start to shout
And I knew what was coming so I tuned him out
And now the old man's gone, and I'd give all I own
To hear what he said when I wasn't listening
To my old man

I miss the old man tonight
And I can almost see his face
He was always trying to watch his weight
And his heart only made it to fifty-eight
For the first time since he died
Late last night I cried
I wondered when I was gonna do that
For my old man"

Standing at the threshold of another paindriving reign

Caressing the bleakness a smile from the living dead
In praise of sanity the courage to leave it all behind
The Swan's song the rejection of the light once more"

Always wrong with this or that
Poisoned with fear watch it twist
My measly brain mad

Talk about me when my back is turned
Next time we meet it will be to late
The memory burned in my ears of what you said
And now I've got a recipe for hate. Taste it

Fill solos - Mustaine

Dark clouds on the horizon
Make it hard to breathe
A walking mistake but every time
I run away, I just come back for more

The choice is clear I can quit
And fall on my sword or light a fire
To see who runs or stays
And plays the confidence game

I looked back once and all I saw was his face
Smiling, the needle crying
Walking out of his room with mirrors, afraid
I heard him scream: ""You'll never get away.""

Cold and shaking I crawled down alleys
To try and scrape away the tracks that marked me
Slammed my face into walls of concrete
I stared, amazed at the words written on the wall

Don't ever trust
Don't ever trust the needle, it lies
Don't ever trust
Don't ever trust the needle when it cries
Cries your name

Wet and raving, the needle keeps calling me back
To bloody my hands forever
Carved my cure with the blade that left me in scars
Now every time I'm weak, words scream from my arm

Don't ever trust

For the good Gentile girls and the good Gentile boys
When the boss busted in, nearly scared 'em half to death
Had a rifle in his hands and cheap whiskey on his breath
From his beard to his boots he was covered with ammo
Like a big fat drunk disgruntled Yuletide Rambo
And he smiled as he said, with a twinkle in his eye,
""Merry Christmas to all - now you're all gonna die!""

The night Santa went crazy
The night St. Nick went insane
Realized he'd been gettin' a raw deal
Something finally must have snapped in his brain

Well the workshop is gone now, he decided to bomb it
Everywhere you'll find pieces of Cupid and Comet
Then he tied up his helpers and he held the elves hostage
And he ground up poor Rudolph into reindeer sausage
He got Dancer and Prancer with an old German Luger
And he slashed up Dasher just like Freddy Krueger
And he picked up a flamethrower and he barbecued Blitzen
And he took a big bite and said ""It tastes just like chicken!""

The night Santa went crazy
The night Kris Kringle went nuts
Now you can't hardly walk around the North Pole
Without steppin' in reindeer guts

There's the National Guard and the F.B.I.

In a federal prison for his infamous crime
Hey, little friend, now don't you cry no more tears

But now Vixen's in therapy and Donner's still nervous
And the elves all got jobs working for the postal service
And they say Mrs. Claus, she's on the phone every night
With her lawyer negotiating the movie rights

""Stories of old,"" I knelt to the Hobo;

Don't ask me now to wash away the grime;
I can't come in 'cause it's too high a climb,""

Walk before the house where we had our games

People like you made me question blame
Huddled in strength like birds on a sloping wire

Hearing your voice makes me so uneasy
Hearing your voice makes me question fame
Money is deaf to the sound of a lover's cry

The language of loss made me so much older
The language of loss made me lose my grip
The language of loss made me silent as a newborn child

'Cause everything moves in a shifting cycle
The unison soars and the pressure dips
Making our way steadfast in the skyward mile

And baby I know I will see you someday
Building your house on the very street
You severed your mother's life from your father's land

Finish your home we can join them this way
We talked about peace and a little dream
Marriage and love and divorce we don't understand

And you know I have to sway my leaves and branches slowly
Out in the sun, like the silent shout of youth

And we ask why do we take these leaps and chances
Because we have no choice but to wither into truth

And I dreamed you were there
All the vital signs were standing
When I dreamed you were with me
With the summer at my back

And I dreamed you were there
So complete and undemanding
We know the love that gives
Is what the living always lack

And you know I have to sway my leaves and branches slowly
Out in the sun, like the silent shout of youth

They'd tell stories that would warm my soul

Fly me high on an angel's wing

Leave out nothing, tell me everything

Everywhere we went just looked the same to me
The skies were blue and the grass was green
I wonder how different I might see them now
Yet I see them somehow

Through the fallen memories when that angel baby signs
Oh, the little magic that his solo brings
Making up songs and words and singin' from the soul
Oh, the stories told
None but him and Jimmy could know

405,ML406,Carla Bruni,Le Ciel Dans Une Chambre,relaxed,"Quand tu es près de moi
Cette chambre n'a plus de parois
Mais des arbres oui, des arbres infinis
Et quand tu es tellement près de moi
C'est comme si ce plafond-là
Il n'existait plus, je vois le ciel penché sur nous... qui restons ainsi
Abandonnés tout comme si
Il n'y avait plus rien, non plus rien d'autre au monde
J'entends l'harmonica... mais on dirait un orgue
Qui chante pour toi et pour moi
Là-haut dans le ciel infini
Et pour toi, et pour moi

Quando sei qui con me
Questa stanza non ha piu pareti
Ma alberi, alberi infiniti
E quando tu sei vicino a me
Questo soffitto, viola, no
Non esiste più, e vedo il cielo sopra a noi
Che restiamo quì, abbandonati come se
Non ci fosse più niente più niente al mondo
Suona l'armonica, mi sembra un organo
Che canta per te e per me
Su nell'immensità del cielo
E per te e per me
mmmhhh

Et pour toi, et pour moi
mmmhhh"
408,ML409,The Cure,One Hundred Years,sad,"It doesn't matter if we all die
Ambition in the back of a black car
In a high building there is so much to do
Going home time, a story on the radio

Something small falls out of your mouth and we laugh
A prayer for something better
A prayer for something better
Please love me, meet my mother
But the fear takes hold
Creeping up the stairs in the dark, waiting for the death blow
Waiting for the death blow
Waiting for the death blow

Stroking your hair as the patriots are shot
Fighting for freedom on the television
Sharing the world with slaughtered pigs
Have we got everything? She struggles to get away
The pain and the creeping feeling, a little black haired girl
Waiting for Saturday, the death of her father pushing her
Pushing her white face into the mirror
Aching inside me and turn me round, just like the old days
Just like the old days
Just like the old days
Just like the old days

Caressing an old man and painting a lifeless face
Just a piece of new meat in a clean room
The soldiers close in under a yellow moon
All shadows and deliverance, under a black flag
A hundred years of blood, crimson, the ribbon tightens round my throat
I open my mouth and my head bursts open
A sound like a tiger, thrashing in the water, thrashing in the water
Over and over, we die one after the other
Over and over, we die one after the other
One after the other
One after the other
One after the other
One after the other
It feels like a hundred years
A hundred years
A hundred years
A hundred years
A hundred years"

Walking softly holding hands
And I thought I heard her say

As we walked I felt her eyes
Reaching deeply into mine
And I thought I heard her sigh
She loved me

And along the way we shared a thought or two
It seemed as if I knew her well
Then she leaned to me and as we gently kissed
I knew that moment my heart fell

She was here

Now I'm lost in wondering
As if waking suddenly
Was it real or just a dream
Where is she?

Was she really here today?
Or was I just drifting back
To the times I heard her say
She loved me

Was she really here today?
She loved me

In his bed I am queen, unobtainable me

I remember gazing on this quiet night
The stars were bright as they could be
Wondering if things would ever go right
And if there was a spot up there for me
Then one star got brighter by the minute
Strange that it seemed to have my name written in it
I reached for the star and it kissed me with it's light
It made me cast a show that was silver and bright

Silver shadow
Glowing shadow
Shining brightly

I never had any real reason
To thank my lucky stars
But now I got a pretty good reason cause
I know I'm gonna go so far
I believe in magic, I really do
With all that's happened, it's got to be true
I cast a silver shadow from the kiss of the light
I knew that I was destined starting with tonight

My future shadow

Of a star I would be

Oh, since I was chosen among the rest
I dedicate myself, I'm gonna be the very best
And my shadow forever silver will remain
And the world will always remember my name

The Caribbean's all booked out
And that's just as well
Once I'd have been much keener
On Barbados and Antigua
But just now I think the Arctic will suit us well
Let's you and me go away
To the Ice Hotel

They've built it all with ice, that's pure and clear
The sofas, the lobby
Even the chandelier
A thermostat guarantees
A steady minus five degrees
What other place could serve our needs so well?
Let's you and me go away
To the Ice Hotel

Romantic places
Like Verona or Paris
They'll always lead you astray
You'd have to be a novice
To ever trust Venice
And those dreamy waterways
And what the tropics can do
I know only too well
So, let's you and me go away
To the Ice Hotel

Heavy clothing at all times
Is the expected norm
Even candlelight at dinner
Is considered too dangerously warm
And when the time comes for us to sleep
We'll spread out our reindeer fleece
And curl up together
On an ice block carved for two
But then in the morning
Provided we've made it through...

We'll step out together
To watch the sun rise over
That vast expanse of cold
And who knows if we're lucky
We may find ourselves talking
Of what the future may hold
This is no whim of the moment
I want you to realize
Let's go away
To that palace made of ice

Let's you and me go away to the Ice Hotel
The Bahamas are all booked out
And that's just as well
I don't think we're quite ready
For Hawaii or Tahiti
And when we will be
Only time will tell
Let's you and me go away

I will rearrange my plans
And change for you.

If I could go back
That's the first thing I would do
I swear that I would
Do my best to follow through,
Come up with a master plan,
A homerun hit, a winning stand
A guarantee, and not promise
That I'd never let your love slip
From my hands.

If it's the beaches,
If it's the beaches, sands you want,
Then you will have them.
If it's the mountains, bending rivers
Then you will have them.

Your presence kept me floating
Far from depths where secrets lie
Maybe in another lifetime
I could be the first you meet

I once read a poem
Held my breath
But that moment's gone
First time I felt
Life somewhat hurts
I need an option, a reason, and some hope

Yell at me, I want to be your light that shines
But my ground is shaking and I might fall
I wish that I could say
I wish that I could be your evil in a closet

When she and Edwin fell in love

Now, at last, you're really here

Where've you been?
I've looked for you forever and a day
Where've you been?
I'm just not myself when you're away""

He asked her for her hand for life
And she became a salesman's wife
He was home each night by eight
But one stormy evening he was late
Her frightened tears fell to the floor
Until his key turned in the door

Where've you been?
I've looked for you forever and a day
Where've you been?
I'm just not myself when you're away

They'd never spent a night apart
For sixty years she heard him snore
Now they're in a hospital
In separate beds on different floors

Claire soon lost her memory
Forgot the names of family
She never spoke a word again
Then, one day, they wheeled him in
He held her hand and stroked her head
In a fragile voice, she said

""Where've you been?
I've looked for you forever and a day
Where've you been?
I'm just not myself when you're away

Dragging at criss-crossing bars

Drawn into the stream
Of undefined illusion
Those diamond dreams
They can't disguise the truth
That there is something about you

I wouldn't be without you baby tonight

If ever our love was concealed
No one can say that we didn't feel
A million things
And a perfect dream of life
Gone, fragile but free
We remain tender together

It's not so wrong
We're only human after all

Pay for it, bust your ass 
Lie for it, cheat for it 
Forget about your past

You get a rise from it

Women will die for it 
Looking back, cut the crap 
Was it really worth the rap? 
It's hard to survive the pain of love 

Ooh I need a time out 
Time to make my mind up 
Substitute a line out 
I'll be back next season with a bang 

No release from the jail 
No parole, no bail 
Hard labor, fifty lashes 
Hard labor, money splashes

Applying final touches

His firearms by his side
Hearin no sound
Just watchin the fireworks in the sky
I walk by
Look down he still smiling
'Cause he's done fightin
A fallen soldier
Now his war's over
Don't matter which side is wrong or right
Some innocent lives will be lost on the battlefield tonight
So hungry to kill
Only his death can curb his appetite
Live ammo hit the flesh
And it feels so right
I've embellished my life
Now God please tell me is this what death's like?
Kept his innocence

Clingin on to anything intimate
She can find around the house

Sheik Ahmed Yassin, Osama Bin Laden
Or Idi Amin

It seems to me they on the same team
They hate only lead to innocent blood streams
If it's so important
To fight for mankind
Well I don't see none of they kinfolk
Out there on the front line.

And I'm a soldier
Right here hip-hop with my guns by my side
Ready to ride till I die
And I'm a soldier

Even when the man dies
They say a soldier never cries
And I'm a soldier
Until the day they take my life

Am I better off this way

Saying you should be with me instead
Every time I'm feeling down, I wonder
What would it be like with you around

So I, I made my way
Cold and roaming in the wild
I'm forever changed
By someone I never knew
Now I've, I've got a place
I've got a husband and a child
But I'll never forget
What I've given up in you

(2Pac) I got nuttin to lose
It's just me against the world
(Girl) Oh-hah
(2Pac) Stuck in the game
Me against the world baby

Verse One: 2Pac

Can you picture my prophecy?
Stress in the city, the cops is hot for me
The projects is full of bullets, the bodies is droppin'
There ain't no stoppin' me
Constantly movin while makin' millions
Witnessin killings, leavin' dead bodies in abandoned buildings
Carries to children 'cause they're illin
Addicted to killin' and the appeal from the cap peelin
Without feelin', but will they last or be blasted?
Hard headed bastard
Maybe he'll listen in his casket -- the aftermath
More bodies being buried -- I'm losing my homies in a hurry
They're relocating to the cemetery
Got me worried, stressin, my vision's blurried
The question is will I live? No one in the world loves me
I'm headed for danger, don't trust strangers
Put one in the chamber whenever I'm feelin' this anger
Don't wanna make excuses, cause this is how it is
What's the use unless we're shootin no one notices the youth
It's just me against the world baby

(Girl) Me against the world
(2Pac) It's just me against the world
(Girl) Ooh yeah, ooh-hoo
(2Pac) It's just me against the world
(Girl) Me against the world
(2Pac) 'Cause it's just me against the world baby
(Girl) Hey!
(2Pac) Me against the world
(Girl) Ooh yeah
(2Pac) I got nuttin to lose
It's just me against the world baby
(Girl) I got nothing to lose

Verse Two: Dramacydal

Could somebody help me? I'm out here all by myself
See ladies in stones, Baby Capone's, livin' wealthy
Pictures of my birth on this Earth is what I'm dreamin'
Seein Daddy's semen, full of crooked demons, already crazy
And screamin I guess them nightmares as a child
Had me scared, but left me prepared for a while
Is there another route? For a crooked Outlaw
Veteran, a villain, a young thug, who one day shall fall

Everday there's mo'death, and plus I'm dough-less
I'm seein mo' reasons for me to proceed with thievin
Scheme on the scheming and leave they peeps grieving
Cause ain't no bucks to stack up, my nuts is backed up
I'm bout to act up, go load the Mac up, now watch me klacka
Tried makin' fat cuts, but yo it ain't workin
And Evil's lurking, I can see him smirking
When I gets to pervin, so what?
Go put some work in, and make my mail, makin' sales
Risking 25 with a 'L', but oh well

(Girl) Me against the world
(2Pac) With nuttin to lose
It's just me against the world
(Girl) Ooh yeah... ooh-ooh

(Girl) Me against the world, hoah

I got nuttin to lose
It's just me against the world baby
(Girl) Ha-hah (hehe) hey!

Verse Three: 2Pac

With all this extra stressin
The question I wonder is after death, after my last breath
When will I finally get to rest? Through this supression
They punish the people that's askin questions
And those that possess, steal from the ones without possesions
The message I stress: to make it stop study your lessons
Don't settle for less - even the genius asks-es questions
Be grateful for blessings
Don't ever change, keep your essence
The power is in the people and politics we address
Always do your best, don't let the pressure make you panic
And when you get stranded
And things don't go the way you planned it
Dreamin' of riches, in a position of makin' a difference
Politicians and hypocrites, they don't wanna listen
If I'm insane, it's the fame made a brother change
It wasn't nuttin like the game
It's just me against the world

(Girl) Me against the world
(2Pac) Nuttin to lose
It's just me against the world baby
(Girl) Me against the world
(2Pac) Got me stuck in the game
It's just me against the world
(Girl) Oahah
(2Pac) I'd be ashamed to lose
It's just me against the world baby
(Girl) Me against the world

Outro: 2Pac

Heh, hahahahahahah
That's right
I know it seem hard sometimes but uh
Remember one thing
Through every dark night, there's a bright day after that

Keep your head up, and handle it

You would know, wouldn't you? You extend your hand to those who suffer
To those who know what it really feels like
To those who've had a taste like that means something
And oh so sick I am and maybe I don't have a choice
And maybe that is all I have and maybe this is a cry for help

I do not want this

Attach her to a lie detector
Watch a thousand housewives fizz and burn
And every time she answers yes

Just go round in circles like his brain

Got a touch of Einstein to her brain
She wears fat clothes but she's cunning
People say she's easy all the same

Days since I last pissed; cheeks sunken and despaired. 
So gorgeous, sunk to six stone; lose my only remaining home 
See my third rib appear, a week later all my flesh disappears. 
Stretching taut, cling-film on bone; I'm getting better 

Karen says I've reached my target weight, 
Kate and Emma and Kristin know it's fake
Problem is ""diet""'s not a big enough word

I wanna be so skinny that I rot from view

I want to walk in the snow and not leave a footprint
I want to walk in the snow and not soil its purity

Stomach collapsed at five; lift up my skirt my sex is gone. 
Naked and lovely and 5 st. 2; may I bud and never flower
My vision's getting blurred but I can see my ribs and I feel fine. 
My hands are trembling stalks and I can feel my breasts are shrinking

Mother tries to choke me with roast beef, and sits savouring her sole Ryvita
""That's the way you're built"", my father said

But I can change; my cocoon shedding

I want to walk in the snow and not leave a footprint
I want to walk in the snow and not soil its purity

Kate and Kristin and Kit-Kat; all things I like looking at
Too weak to fuss, too weak to die. Choice is skeletal in everybody's life
I choose, my choice, I starve to frenzy. Hunger soon passes and sickness soon tires
Legs bent, stockinged, I am Twiggy. And I don't mind the horror that surrounds me
Self-worth scatters, self-esteem's a bore; I long since moved to a higher plateau
This discipline's so rare, so please applaud. Just look at the fat scum who pamper me so

795,ML796,Beastie Boys,The Sounds Of Science,happy,"Now here we go dropping science dropping it all over
Like bumping around the town like when you're driving a Range Rover
Expanding the horizons and expanding the parameters
Expanding the rhymes of sucker M.C. amateurs

And Naugels, Isaac Newton and Scientific E.Z.
Ah Ben Franklin with the kite ah gettin' over with the key
Now rock shocking the mic as many times times the times tables
Rock well to tell dispel all of the old fables

'Cause I've been dropping the new science
And I've been kicking the new knowledge
An M.C. to a degree that you can't get in college

Now the dregs of the earth and the eggs that I eat
I've got pegs through my hands and one through my feet
Shea Stadium the radium E M D squared
Kicked out of the Palladium you think that I cared

It's the sound of science
The sounds of science
Science..

Rope a dope
The newest in new
""Right up to your face and dis you""
Waxin' and milkin'
All of ya'll square heads

Time and money for girls covered with honey
You lie and aspire to be as cunning
Reeling and rockin' and rollin' B size D cup
Order the quarter deluxe why don't you wake up

My mind is kinda flowin' like an oil projector
Had to get up to get the Jimmy protector
Went berserk and worked and exploded
She woke up in the morning and her face was coated

Buddy you study the man on the mic
D. do what you like huh D.
Well Drunk a skunk am I from the celebration
To peep that freak unique penetration

Well I figured out who makes the crack
It's the suckers with the badges and the blue jackets
A professor of science 'cause I keep droppin' it
I smell weed 'cause y'all be packin'

And people always asking what's the phenomenon
""Yo what's up"" yo what's goin' on
No one really knows what I'm talking about
Yeah that's right, my name's Yauch

Ponce De Leon constantly on
The fountain of youth not Robotron
Peace is a word I've heard before
So move and move and move upon the dance floor

'Cause I'm gonna' die gonna' die one day
'Cause I'm goin' and goin' and goin' this way
Not like a roach or a piece of toast
I'm goin' out first class ain't goin' out coach

Rock my Adidas never rock Fila
""I do not sniff the coke I only smoke the sinsemilla""
Well with my nose I knows and with my scopes I scope
What I live I write and that is strictly rope

I've got science for any occasion
Postulating theorems formulating equations
Well Cheech wizard in a snow blizzard
Eating chicken gizzards with a girl named Lizzy

Droppin' science like Galileo dropped the orange"

Here's your ticket

The crew to you to push the back to Black
Attack so I sat and japped
Then slapped the Mac (Intosh)
Now I'm ready to mike it
(You know I like it) huh
Hear my favoritism roll ""Oh""
Never be a brother like to go solo
Lazer, anastasia, maze ya
Ways to blaze your brain and train ya
The way I'm livin', forgiven'
What I'm givin' up
X on the flex hit me now
I don't know about later
As for now I know how to avoid the paranoid
Man I've had it up to here
Gear I wear got 'em goin' in fear
Rhetoric said
Read just a bit ago
Not quittin' though
Signed the hard rhymer
Work to keep from gettin' jerked
Changin' some ways
To way back in the better days
Raw metaphysically bold
Never followed a code
Still dropped a load
Never question what I am God knows
'Cause it's comin' from the heart
What I got better get some
(Get on up) hustler of culture
Snakebitten
Been spit in the face
But the rhymes keep fittin'
Respects been givin' how's ya livin'
Now I can't protect a pad off defect
Check the record
An reckon an intentional wreck
Played off as some intellect
Made the call, took the fall
Broke the laws
Not my fault they're fallin' off
Known as fair square
Throughout my years
So I growl at the livin' foul
Black to the bone my home is your home
So welcome to the Terrordome
Subordinate terror
Kickin' off an era
Cold deliverin' pain
My 98 was 87 on a record yo
So now I go Bronco

Crucifixion ain't no fiction
So called chosen frozen
Apology made to who ever pleases
Still they got me like Jesus
I rather sing, bring, think reminisce
'Bout a brother while I'm in sync
Every brother ain't a brother cause a color
Just as well could be undercover
Backstabbed, grabbed a flag
From the back of the lab
Told a Rab get off the rag
Sad to say I got sold down the river
Still some quiver when I deliver
Never to say I never know or had a clue
Word was heard, plus hard on the boulevard
Lies, scandalizin', basin'
Traits of hate who's celebratin' wit Satan?
I rope a dope the evil with righteous
Bobbin' and weavin' and let the good get even
C'mon down
And welcome to the Terrordome.
Caught in the race against time
The pit and the pendulum
Check the rhythm and rhymes
While I'm bendin' 'em
Snakes blowin' up the lines of design
Tryin' to blind the science I'm snedin' 'em
How to fight the power
Cannot run and hide
But it shouldn't be suicide
In a game a fool without the rules
Got a hell of a nerve to just criticize
Every brother ain't a brother
Cause a Black hand
Squeezed on Malcolm X the man
The shootin' of Huey Newton
From a hand of a Nigger who pulled the trigger

It's weak to speak and blame somebody else
When you destroy yourself
First nothing's worse than a mother's pain
Of a son slain in Bensonhurst
Can't wait for the state to decide the fate
So this jam I dedicate
Places with racist faces
Just an example of one of many cases
The Greek weekend speech I speak
From a lesson learned in Virginia (Beach)
I don't smile in the line of fire
I go wildin'
But it's on bass and drums even violins
Watcha do gitcha head ready
Instead of gettin' physically sweaty
When I get mad
I put it down on a pad
Give ya somethin' that cha never had controllin'
Fear of high rollin'
God bless your soul and keep livin'
Never allowed, kickin' it loud
Droppin' a bomb
Brain game intellectual Vietnam
Move as a team
Never move alone
But
Welcome to the Terrordome"

Multiple personalities
Terror inside of me
A mask of silent agony

Curse the falling rain
The vortex of pain

As medieval as Merlin
A pact for power was made
Lucifer in transition
It's time, time the price was paid

Scorching the domain
The vortex of pain

A telestic message
Written in torment
Howl out dirges
Like the horns of Jericho
Distorted faces writhing in rage
Walls of purgatory tumble down
Endless death
The jewels of a crown

Every little meaning in my life
It's been fine
I've been cool

Is there a God?
Why is he waiting?
Don't you think of it odd
When he knows my address?
And look at the stars
Don't it remind you just how feeble we are?
Well it used to, I guess

I wear a new cologne and
You wouldn't know me if your eyes were closed
I know what you'll say

But you're wrong this time

Numb is the new deep
Done with the old me
I'm over the analyzing

Always open knowing all the time I'm probably
Never gonna find the perfect rhyme

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where troubles melt like lemondrops
Away above the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me

Somewhere over the rainbow
Bluebirds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why, then, oh why can't I?

Without no reply

I wish I would be better

I want to say, ""come to me 'cause I won't run""

In our neutral meeting place, the Episcopalian churchyard
I had things I'd been meaning to say
But in the dazzling winter sun that late, I could feel them melt away

And through the warm radio static
I couldn't hear my stage directions
And the fog on the windshield
Obscured our sad reflections

I felt so desperate
In your arms
I felt so desperate
In your arms

We were parked near some trees
And the moonlight soaked the branches in ever deepening degrees
Had my hand in your hair
Trying to keep my cool until it became too much to bear

When we cracked the windows open
Well, the air was just so sweet
We could hear the cars ten feet away
Out there in the street

I felt so desperate
In your arms
I felt so desperate
In your arms"

The world shows its face for another scar

Dead will dance for what is left
The worms will wait with baited breath

Flags are flying, dollar bills
'Round the heights of concrete hills
You can see the pinnacles

Candy and taffy, hope we both are well
Please come see me in the citadel

In the streets are many walls
Hear the peasants come and crawl
You can hear their lovers call

Candy and taffy, hope we both are well
Please come see me in the citadel

Screaming people fly so fast
In their shiny metal cars
Through the woods of steel and glass

Candy and taffy, hope we both are well
Please come see me in the citadel, oh well"

There is always a reason
I know that love is there for us

Be creative, and show me your flavor

Let life
Let love
Let God

Where we'll go, baby I don't know
Maybe we should just let nature run the show

The wind blows
Like the birds fly
And the moon glows
If I am meant for you and
You are meant for me
Then we will flow together
Everlastly

Where we'll go, baby I don't know
Maybe we should just let nature run the show
Maybe we should just sit and watch the flowers grow
Maybe we should sit, back and watch the moon glow
Maybe we should just sit and feel the wind blow
Maybe, maybe, maybe...

First you plant a seed
And then it grows and
Then it blooms
And it dies

Go with the flow
Maybe we'll get it right..."

We are the something that will not conform

We are the useless by-products of soulless meat
We are all gone we all sing the same tragedy

Open wide and eat the worms of the enemy
We are the enemies of reality, in a world that's unforgiving

Waiting to sanitize bastard tongues
To purify the ignorance that hides the sun
The less you understand the more you're driven

Packaged and processed the masses are force fed
The standards they judge us on swallow the rot we shed

Open wide and eat the worms of the enemy
We are the enemies of reality, in a world that's unforgiving

Breathing dust and decay while I'm sipping
Human trust and betrayal
Losing faith once again
Take my hand my friend, my foe, I am enemy

Open wide, eat the words, become what you most fear"

Bloodletting a favorite game of solitaire
A suicide mission destined to fail
A moving ladder to climb taking me away
I wouldn't have it any other way"

After all these years you're here and you remember me

But she always knew someday he would go

She just got a new job and she doubts it will last
So let's take a drink and never think and here's to the past
She said it's so funny how life burns out so fast
It's just another wasted day

A boring life in a boring town with the same old crowd
And I used to say that I'd never stay, but I'm rotting here today
With that same old crowd that's always been around
And I always thought I'd be the first to go

That same old crowd that drags me down
Another day in a boring town
That same old crowd that brings me down
A boring life in a boring town

Just talked to this girl who used to live on my street
After all these years you're here and it's still just you and me
Sometimes I can't believe after all these years
I just think I'll never leave here

She said it's so funny how life burns out so fast
So let's take another drink and here's to the past

That same old crowd that drags me down
Another day in a boring town
That same old crowd that brings me down
A boring life in a boring town

And remember when they'd look through you
And they'd look past me?
We were the ones they said would always leave
So when you go, just think of me, think of me

A boring life in a boring town with the same old crowd
And I used to say that I'd never stay, but I'm rotting here today
With that same old crowd that's always been around
And I always thought that, and I always thought that

Infatuation or true desire
The thrill of discovery, divine intervention
Cruel, cruel change, pain of rejection
As you walk away, think of all the joy we shared
If you decide you need me, I'll be wondering if I care
Not there to soothe your soul, friend to tender friend
I think our love is coming to an end
King persuader, congratulations
Share her heart, you bought her soul
Princess confusion, come to me again
Saying goodbye was so much fun
When you walk away, feel the freedom in your heart
There's a joy in letting go, free to find a love apart
When I lose control, I need a kind, forgiving friend
But I think our love is coming to an end
I know our love is coming to an end"

951,ML952,Jens Lekman,Friday Night at the Drive-In Bingo,happy,"In a tiny, tiny southern Swedish country town
Two acres of field and a gas station
Riding on my moped, looking for fun
Staring into the blood-red sun
Oh, the country road is a boulevard
With neon lights and night-open bars
In my jacket, pack of playing cards
Just jacks, jokers, and a queen of hearts

My heart is beating, beating like Ringo
As I pull into the drive-in bingo

Why do the people in the country want to look like the people in the city
When the people in the city aren't the slightest pretty?
I want the people in the country to wear flannel shirts
And saggy jeans all covered in dirt
I want the people in the country to be open and kind
But most times I've met those with a narrow mind
With a big black dog to bite your behind
If they ever find out you're not one of their kind

All these thoughts as I open up a zingo
Friday night at the drive-in bingo

So this is what they do out here for fun?
They play bingo and let their engines run
Tonight's jackpot is a pig, hey, that's criminal
G-42, ooh, I'm going diagonal
I'm gonna gather up a few of my friends
As many fits into an army tent
Just bring your savings and a bottle of wine
To Friday night's reversal of time

This little southwest village shouldn't cost that much
Maybe a handful of silver or a hundred bucks
We could have wild, wild parties in that big old lodge
And the windmill's perfect for movies and such
We could fake our deaths to get insurance money
And take on hippie names, I'd be Snowphish, you'd be Sunny
We could start a little farm with little white bunnies
Just 'cause watching them copulate is very funny

There's a cow and an ostrich just waiting for you
A glass of apple cider just waiting for you
The smell of 1952 just waiting for you
And all I'm doing here is just waiting for you

A daydream, I'm caught up in limbo
Friday night at the drive-in bingo"
953,ML954,Mýa,Now or Never,happy,"I've seen the rest before
And I've settled for less before
An offer so much more
Has been knocking upon my door
Don't hesitate or so I've heard that
Eventually you'll quit waiting for me
Since I know we both belong in arms in crazy love
I gotta open up before you leave

Baby it's time to get up on track
And give it all back to you
I know that you love me
You're always there for me
Baby it's time to get up on track
And give it all back to you
I could lose you forever
And it's now or never

Oh no oh no oh no oh no
We spend the entire day
How you always knew what to say oh
You never asked to stay
And I can't believe that I couldn't see
Gotta open up before you leave me lonely oh

Oh no oh no oh no oh no
Now or never
Oh no oh no oh no oh no

I know we both belong in arms
I know it's crazy love
I know we both belong in arms
I know it's crazy love, it's crazy love

But I'm gonna try for the kingdom if I can

And I tell ya things aren't quite the same
When I'm rushing on my run
And I feel just like Jesus' son

I have made the big decision
I'm gonna try to nullify my life

When it shoots up the dropper's neck
When I'm closing in on death

And you can't help me now, you guys
And all you sweet girls with all your sweet talk
You can all go take a walk

And I guess that I just don't know

I wish that I was born a thousand years ago
I wish that I'd sail the darkened seas
On a great big clipper ship
Going from this land here to that
In a sailor's suit and cap

Away from the big city where a man can not be free
Of all of the evils of this town
And of himself, and those around
Oh and I guess that I just don't know
Oh and I guess that I just don't know

Heroin, be the death of me
Heroin, it's my wife and it's my life
Because a mainer to my vein
Leads to a center in my head
And then I'm better off than dead

Because when the smack begins to flow
I really don't care anymore
About all the Jim-Jim's in this town
And all the politicians making busy sounds
And everybody putting everybody else down
And all the dead bodies piled up in mounds

'Cause when the smack begins to flow
Then I really don't care anymore

Ah, when the heroin is in my blood
And that blood is in my head
Then thank God that I'm as good as dead
Then thank your God that I'm not aware
And thank God that I just don't care

Beyond faded tears I hide
I wish the rain would stay away

River, did you bring me here
Touch me now, wipe away my fear
River, miles and miles to flow
Shake this land, reap where sounds will grow

Now his love journeys on the river
Heart of darkness, endless trail
I am feeling the edge, can I be strong
Now I will believe your song
Beneath diamond skies I dream
Two lonely hearts no more belong

With no way to hold my head that didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't bad
So I had one more for dessert
Then I fumbled in my closet through my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
Then I washed my face and combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs to meet the day

I'd smoked my mind the night before
With cigarettes and the songs I'd been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Playin' with a can that he was kicking
Then I walked across the street
And caught the Sunday smell of someone's fryin' chicken
And it took me back to somethin'
That I'd lost somewhere, somehow along the way

On a Sunday morning sidewalk
I'm wishing, Lord, that I was stoned
'Cause there's something in a Sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothin' short of dyin'
That's half as lonesome as the sound
Of a sleepin' city sidewalk
And Sunday mornin' comin' down

In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughin' little girl that he was swingin'
And I stopped beside a Sunday school
And listened to the songs they were singin'
Then I headed down the street
And somewhere far away a lonely bell was ringin'
And it echoed through the canyon
Like the disappearing dreams of yesterday

On a Sunday morning sidewalk
I'm wishing, Lord, that I was stoned
'Cause there's something in a Sunday
That makes a body feel alone

God is dead and no one cares
If there is a Hell, I'll see you there

He flexed his muscles to keep his flock of sheep in line
He made a virus that would kill off all the swine
His perfect kingdom of killing, suffering and pain
Demands devotion, atrocities done in his name

From a dark place 

And so I pray every night 

Something knows me 
It whispers my name 
And I'm losing my faith 

I can feel it breathing 
But it feels like something dead and cold 

I can feel it waiting 
But it waits for something in my soul 

Sometimes I call out for you, and sometimes I'm afraid 

So I beg God 
For salvation, for an angel 
Every night 

And I ask God 
Can He forgive me? 
And I want to believe 

I think I hear it laughing 
But it sounds like my voice lost and old 

I think it showed me Heaven 
And now I know why I'm scared to die 

Am I a fool in the dark, I don't know 
Am I the ghost in my dreams, I don't know 
Am I a shadow of life, I don't know 
Am I afraid of the truth, I don't know 

Sometimes I call out for you, and sometimes I'm afraid 

So I ask for 
One small mercy? 
But it whispers 'Who are you?' 

So I ask God 
If He can save me? 
He says 'It's all too dark'"

She said she never liked you from the start
Well me, I wish that I could claim the same
But you always knew you held my heart

And you're such a charming, handsome man
Now I think I finally understand
Is it in your genes, I don't know
But I'll soon find out, that's for sure
Why did you play me this way?

Well I guess what you say is true
I could never be the right kind of girl for you
I could never be your woman

I could never be your woman
I could never be your woman
I could never be your woman

Well I guess what they say is true
I could never spend my life with a man like you
I could never be your woman

I could never be your woman
I could never be your woman
I could never be your woman"

Good always wins, again and again
And love is a sweet dream, that always comes true
Oh if life were like the movies, I'd never be blue

But here in the real world, it's not that easy at all
'Cause when hearts get broken, it's real tears that fall
And darlin' it's sad but true, but the one thing I've learned from you
Is how the boy don't always get the girl, here in the real world

I gave you my love, but that wasn't enough
To hold your heart, when times got rough
And tonight on that silver screen, it'll end like it should
Two lovers will make it through, like I hoped we would

But here in the real world, it's not that easy at all

One little smile, and after a while, a longing to forget
One little heartache left as a token
One little plaything carelessly broken

Remember the night
The night you said, ""I love you""
Remember?

Remember you vowed
By all the stars above you
Remember?

Remember we found a lonely spot
And after I learned to care a lot

You promised that you'd forget me not
But you forgot
To remember

Into my dreams you wandered it seems, and then there came a day
You loved me too; my dreams had come true, and all the world was May
But soon the May-time turned to December
You had forgotten; do you remember?"

Lard's

Lard is all
Lard is divine
Lard is control
Lard whips and chains our soul

(Lard) We carry credit cards
(Lard) We live in fear of art

Lard is the OM
Lard is revolution
Lard is the tapeworm
In the bottle of cheap tequila
That comes alive at night
And sneaks up and bites your nipple

Nowadays, most of us need someone to run our personal life
Someone to see that the plants are watered
Someone to make sure the place is clean
Someone to make sure dinner is waiting
Someone to call for theater tickets
Someone to make up those cheap excuses

What we need is
Lard
Lard

The answer, the dancer, the ointment, the dream
Absorb it, inflame it, respect it, molest it

And told it doesn't have to pay or sacrifice or learn
No one is over the hill when the mountain comes to Mohammed

Poison oak really is the aphrodisiac of the Gods

Yeah

Who will babysit the babysitters?

Ever hear about that guy in New York 
Whose dick fell off in the bath after he shot it full of coke
It's okay to run out of butter in Zambia
Just smear squashed caterpillars on your toast

And a vicious wind blew hard and fast
I should have taken it as a warning
As a warning As a warning
As a warning

I'd given my nurse the weekend off
My meals were ill prepared
My typewriter had turned mute as a tomb
And my piano crouched in the corner of my room
With all its teeth bared
All its teeth bared All its teeth bared
All its teeth bared.

I left my house without my coat
Something my nurse would not have allowed
And I took the small roads out of town
And I passed a cow and the cow was brown
And my pyjamas clung to me like a shroud
Like a shroud Like a shroud
Like a shroud

There rose before me a little house
With all hope and dreams kept within
A woman's voice close to my ear
Said, ""Why don't you come in here?""
""You looked soaked to the skin""
Soaked to the skin Soaked to the skin
Soaked to the skin

Hallelujah Hallelujah
Hallelujah Hallelujah

I turned to the woman and the woman was young
I extended a hearty salutation
But I knew if my nurse had been here
She would never in a thousand years
Permit me to accept that invitation
Invitation That invitation
That invitation

Now, you might think it wise to risk it all
Throw caution to the reckless wind
But with her hot cocoa and her medication
My nurse had been my one salvation

Une lueur scintille dans la nuit,
Et l'ange tombe du haut des cieux,
Les ailes déchirées par son dieu,
Une goutte de plus parmi les pluies.

Son corps a traversé les nuages,
Pour atterrir sur terre, tremblant,
D'un ange, il ne reste plus que le visage, 
La pureté de son teint blanc.

L'homme pauvre sera attristé,
Mais du paradis est venue la haine,
Il ne reste plus, sur son visage blême,
Que malheurs et souffrances ignorés.

""Je voudrais dormir une dernière fois,
Oublier ma douleur et Marie,
DéjÃ  je sens naître de la mort l'ennui,
Mais des autres mondes j'ai perdu la foi"".

(Translation)

(The Angel's Fall)

(Music by Arkdae, Lyrics by Hylgaryss)

A light twinkles in the night
And the angel falls from the heavens
His wings torn by his God
Another drop among the rains

His shell has crossed the clouds
To land on earth, shivering,
Of an angel only remains his face,
The purity of his white complexion

The poor man shall be sad
But from Heaven came hatred
On his pale face only remain
Ignored miseries and sufferings

"" I wish I could sleep one last time,
To forget my pain and Marie,
I already feel boredom in Death,
And I have lost faith in other worlds.. ""

Que hay suelto un corazón
Que no es igual
Que es peligroso, que es distinto

No es lo mismo basta o bastar
Ni es lo mismo, decir, opinar, imponer o mandar

No es lo mismo

No sé si me explico
Que hoy nadie quiere ser igual
Qué mas te da
No es comunismo, es instinto

ich würde jetzt nur so gerne noch ein bißchen was rauchen
hier ist grade nichts am Start
wann kommt endlich mein Grasautomat
ich kann mir aussuchen, wie viel grad es im zimmer sind
kann ich nicht weiter, habe ich sogar Ventilatorrückenwind
ist es heiß, kann ich duschen, mir Regen vorstellen
ja, ich habe auch ein Gerät, durch das die Sonne in der Nacht scheint
kann zwischen 20 verschiedenen Joghurtsorten wählen
und dann kommt noch einer an und sagt, hier würde etwas fehlen
kann immer noch nicht alles kaufen, was ich brauche
und der Konsum tut es dafür von Zeit zu Zeit auch

Looks beyond the credits sum
Livid fractures less of fate
The whisper winds blow the seeds of hate

Disturbed society
Dogs might turn with no values
Intend to raise ability
A tried and tested pointless view
God's got security
Hands like snakes sow the seeds

Raise all negative force-fed
Traces poisons all impure
Profane the haunted heaven
Jeering leapt into the pit of calamity
A mean condition no wealth dents
Provisions for a time unknown
Thelemic gestures are planned and hatched
In seasons of dissolute pain

I cried afflicted and infected
Oblige the system's perfect dream
Distorted my words
Assume all that is programmed before me
And somewhat left unsaid behind shutters

Dirt before desire
Dusted crap ingested comes
Stealing life that you are not visited
Warped torpedo night crawls through
The distant and irrelevant
A good life's experiment fused

I'm laying violent hands upon
A dead card calling cattle
The playthings are so abused
The derelict dial phone clock pusher
Delved in reliving the future too

I'm sticking pins and needles
In this stinging rotten flesh-like substitute
Pieces of half cooked meat that are
Walking on this earth
Abort desire irrelevance ticks in front in view
Ticks in front of you
Ticks in front in view

A candle rhyme to realign
Burnt out shadows on the wall seize the moment

At night the deserts writhed

""Hey, come to Los Angeles!
You and your family can have peace and tranquility.
Enjoy the refinement..""
""Hey Bone, hey nigga where you at though?""
""Hello, my name is Elaine --
And I'll be your tour guide through South Central Los Angeles""

How to survive in South Central (what you do?)
A place where bustin' a cap is fundamental
No, you can't find the shit in a handbook
Take a close look, at a rap crook
Rule number one: get yourself a gun
A nine in your ass'll be fine
Keep it in your glove compartment
'Cause jackers (yo) they love to start shit
Now if you're white you can trust the police
But if you're black they ain't nothin' but beasts
Watch out for the kill
Don't make a false move and keep your hands on the steering wheel
And don't get smart
Answer all questions, and that's your first lesson
On stayin' alive
In South Central, yeah, that's how you survive
""Hi this is Elaine again.
Are you enjoying your stay in South Central Los Angeles,
Or is somebody taking your things? Have you witnessed a drive-by?
Okay, make sure you have your camcorder ready
To witness the extracurricular activities on blacks by the police,
So you and your family can enjoy this tape, over and over again.""
""This is Los Angeles."" ""This is Los Angeles.""

Rule number two: don't trust nobody
Especially a bitch, with a hooker's body
'Cause it ain't nuttin' but a trap
And females'll get jacked and kidnapped
You'll wind up dead
Just to be safe don't wear no blue or red
'Cause most niggaz get got
In either L.A., Compton or Watts
Pissed-off black human beings
So I think you better skip the sight-seeing
And if you're nuttin but a mark
Make sure that you're in before dark
But if you need some affection mate
Make sure the bitch ain't a section eight
'Cause if so that's a monkey-wrench hoe
And you won't survive in South Central
""Now you realize it's not all that it's cracked up to be.
You realize that it's fucked up!
It ain't nothin' like the shit you saw on TV
Palm trees and blonde bitches?
I'd advise to you to pack your shit and get the fuck on;
Punk motherfucker!""
And you need your ass straight smoked
Yo I wanna say whassup to DJ Chilly Chill
Sir Jinx, aiyyo Cube these motherfuckers don't know what time it is
So show these motherfuckers what's happenin'
Tell these motherfuckers, don't fuck around in South Central
God damnit!

Rule number three: don't get caught up
'Cause niggaz are doing anything that's thought up
And they got a vice
On everything from dope, to stolen merchandise
We discern
'Cause South Central L.A., is one big yearn
Waitin' for a brother like you to catch a disease
And start slangin' ki's
To an undercover or the wrong brother
And they'll smother, a out of town motherfucker
So don't take your life for granted
'Cause it's the craziest place on the planet
In L.A. heroes don't fly through the sky of stars
They live behind bars
So everybody's doin' a little dirt
And it's the youngsters puttin' in the most work
So be alert and stay calm
As you enter, the concrete Vietnam
You say, the strong survive
Shit, the strong even die, in South Central
Yeah you bitches, you think I forgot about your ass,
You tramp-ass hoes? You better watch out.
And for you so called baller-ass niggaz,
You know what time it is. South Central ain't no joke.
Got to keep your gat at all times motherfuckers.
Better keep one in the chamber and nine in the clip god damnit.
You'll sho' get got, just like that.
This ain't no joke motherfuckers.
Now I wanna send a shout-out to E-Dog, the engineer,
Puttin' his two cents in...
""This is Los Angeles."""

I'm going down to Yasgur's farm
Think I'll join a rock and roll band
I'll camp out on the land
I'll try and set my soul free

We are stardust, we are golden
And we've got to get ourselves back to the garden

Well, then can I walk beside you?
I have come here to lose the smog
And I feel just like a cog 
In something turning
Well maybe it's the time of year
Or maybe it's the time of man
And I don't know who I am
But life's for learning

We are stardust, we are golden
And we've got to get ourselves back to the garden

They were half a million strong
Everywhere there were songs and celebration
And I dreamed I saw the bombers
Riding shotgun in the sky
Turning into butterflies above our nation

Deep blues and reds
With purple highlights

And fade in my Ahhs

Fade out the parades
And the charades
Making music like love is made
And lovers wait patiently
And with joy
For the right moment
To explor in passion
Why everlasting love is everlasting

But don't forget my Oohhs
And fade in my Ahhs

Ther's no need to argue for better position
Realize the moment that you're in is magic
Stellare regions cry everything has its season
Everything happens for a reason
So who are we to worry at any rate
The plane that crashed
We missed 'cause we were running late
And if success eludes you
Then you must choose to do
What other people wouldn't do

But don't forget my Oohhs
And fade in my Ahhs

So as cold night fades into darkness
Harken to the fire
Where you may find some peace
As many people pass
Some good and some bad
But this fire glows stronger yet
And burning bright reminds us

To ever be reborn
The sun sets soon
Uprises the moon
The sun sets soon
Uprises the moon"

Letting someone into my misery
I told it all step-by-step
How I landed on the island and how I'd swim across the sea
And it crosses my mind that I may awake to a knife in me

No more breath in my hair or ladies' underwear
Tossed up over the alarm clock
Blood dripping from the bed to a neatly written poem, a heartfelt last line reading:
""There is no more mystery"". Is it going to happen, my love?
""There is no more mystery"". Is it going to happen, my love?

""It's all in my head"", she said, ""Morning after nightmare
You're building a wall"", she said, ""Higher than the both of us
So try living life instead of hiding in the bedroom
Show me a smile and I'll promise not to leave you""

We went into a big house and slept in a small bed
I didn't know you then as well as you of me
We talked of our sad lives, and we went off separately
And we went off separately. I found your overseas souvenirs
Holiday greeting cards and some long-forgot high school fears

""It's all in my head"", I said, banging a piano
""I've not been so alone"", I thought, ""Since kicking in the womb""
I drank so much tea, I wrote my letters in Kanji, yeah
Around the block I walked and walked, pretending you were with me

Not wanting to die out here
Without you

The hurting never ends, like birthdays and old friends
We forget that this flesh, blood and bone is human
Trading phone lines for airlines. Unwilling to face
That love is found on the inside, not the outside
And like a medicine bottle in the cabinet I'll keep you
And like a medicine bottle in my hand I will hold you

And swallow you slowly, as to last me a lifetime
Without holding too tight; I do not want to lose
The thrill that it gives me to look out from my window
And scowl at the houses from my world in the bedroom

""It's all in his head,"" she read in a girlfriend's self-help book
""It's all his own making; a war with himself
Like two sides of a wall that separates two countries
He shuts out the world and wants only to love you""

y lleno de dolor
respiré de ese humo
amargo de tu adiós

And to be shown a glimpse of the truth
Made my cheek flush and my mouth smile
My chest's like a cage full of butterflies
It tickled and I laught ""such a rare, rare joy""

Suddenly the balloon loosened itself, he said
""I have to move further on, I'll keep on flying
Keep on showing the truth from my point of view""

1531,ML1532,My Dying Bride,The Light at the End of the World,sad,"An isle, a bright shining isle
Stands forever, alone in the sea
Of rock and of sand and grass
And shale, the isle bereft of trees.

- Small. A speck in the wide blue
Sea. 'Tis the last of all the land.
A dweller upon our lonesome
Isle, the last, lonely man? -

By the Gods he is there to
Never leave, to remain all his
Life. His punishment for
Evermore, to attend the
Eternal light.

The lighthouse, tall and brilliant
White, which stands at the end
Of the world. Protecting ships
And sailors too, from rock they
Could be hurled

Yet nothing comes and nothing
Goes 'sept the bright blue sea.
Which stretches near and far
Away, 't is all our man can see.

Though, one day, up high on
Rock, a bird did perch and cry.
An albatross, he shot a glance,
And wondered deeply, why?

Could it be a watcher sent?
A curse sent from the Gods,
Who sits and cries and stares at him,
The life that they have robbed.

Each year it comes to watch
Over him, the creature from above.
Not a curse but a reminder of
The woman that he loved.

- Oh weary night, under stars,
He'd lay and gaze.
Up towards the moon and stars.
The suns dying haze.

Time and again, Orion's light
Filled our man with joy.
Within the belt, he'd see his love,
Remembering her voice -

The twinkle from the stars above
Bled peace into his heart
As long as she looks down on him
He knows they'll never part

One day good, one day bad
The madness, the heat, the sun,
Out to sea, he spies upon land.
His beloved Albion.

Cliffs of white and trees of green
Children run and play,
'My home land' he cries and weeps,
Why so far away?

Eyes sore and red. Filled with tears,
He runs towards the sea.
To risk his life, a worthy cause,
For home he would be.

Into the sea, deep and blue,
The waters wash him clean.
Awake. He screams. Cold with sweat.
And Albion a dream.

- Such is life upon the isle,
Of torment and woe.
One day good. One day bad.
And some days, even hope.

The light at the end of the world
Burns bright for mile and mile
Yet tends the man, its golden glow,
In misery all the while?

For fifty years he stands and waits,
Atop the light, alone.
Looking down upon his isle
The Gods have made his home -

The watcher at the end of the world
Through misery does defile.
Remembers back to that single night
And allows a tiny smile.

(His sacrifice was not so great,
He insists upon the world.
Again he would crime,
Again he would pay,
For one moment with the girl)

Her hair, long and black it shone,
The dark, beauty of her eyes,
Olive skin and warm embrace,
Her memory never dies.

'Twas years ago, he
Remembers clear
The life they once did live.
Endless love and lust for life,
They promised each would give.

Alas, such love and laughter too,
Was short as panting breath
For one dark night, her soul
Was kissed
By the shade of death.

(Agony, like none before,
Was suffered by our man.)
Who tends the light now
Burning bright
On the very last of land.

(Anger raged and misery too
Like nothing ever before.)
He cursed the Gods and man
And life,
And at his heart he tore.

- A deity felt sympathy
And threw our man a light
'Your woman you may see again,
For a single night. -

But think hard and well young man,
There is a price to pay:
To tend the light at the end of
The world
Is where you must stay.

Away from man and life and love.
Alone you will be.
On a tiny isle. A bright shining isle
In the middle of the sea.'

- 'I'll tend the light, for one more night
With the woman whom I love',
Screamed the man, with tearful eyes,
To the deity above.

And so it was that very night
His lover did return.
To his arms and to their bed,
Together they did turn.

In deepest love and lust and passion
Entwined they did fall.
Lost within each other's arms
They danced (in lover's ball). -

- Long was the night filled with love.
For them the world was done.
Awoke he did to brightest light,
His woman and life had gone.

To his feet he leapt. To the sea he looked.
To the lighthouse on the stone.
The price is paid and from now on
He lives forever alone.

Fifty years have passed since then
And not a soul has he seen.
But his woman lives with him still
In every single dream.

'Tis sad to hear how young love has died
To know that, alone, someone has cried.
But memories are ours to keep.
To live them again, in our sleep.-"

Why should I be able to hate?
Why all this envy?
Should I be able to kill for this land?

To return to where we've been

I know it's tricky when you're feeling low
When you feel like your flavour has gone the way
Of a pre-shelled pistachio

And fed up with your heavy boots
Laced with melancholy notions all your own

I do - like sugar - tend toward the brittle and sticky when spun
And I know my demeanour can go the way
Of a photo left out in the sun
And I try to keep myself in lilies and flax seeds
Oh what a folly, fooling just yourself

Sit down and smoke away
I wouldn't knock it till you're in them shoes
I watch as our subtlety blows away
As a blush it gives way to a bruise
But seemly we'd freely make the trade off
A dry rot to take the weight off
And swap the boots for red shoes"

...For those who hide behind the false image of
The son of man, shall stand before God! It has begun...
The beginning of the end... yeah... yeah... yeah, yeah

The voice of racism preaching the Gospel is devilish
A fake church called the prophet Muhammad a terrorist
Forgetting God is not religion, but a spiritual bond
And Jesus is the most quoted prophet in the Qu'ran
They bombed innocent people, trying to murder Saddam
When you gave him those chemical weapons to go to war with Iran
This is the information that they hold back from Peter Jennings
'Cause Condoleeza Rice is just a new age Sally Hemmings
I break it down with critical language and spiritual anguish
The Judas I hang with, the guilt of betraying Christ
You murdered and stole his religion, and painting him white
Translated in psychologically tainted philosophy
Conservative political right wing, ideology
Glued together sloppily, the blasphemy of a nation
Got my back to the wall, 'cause I'm facing assassination
Guantanamo Bay, federal incarceration
How could this be, the land of the free, home of the brave?
Indigenous holocaust, and the home of the slaves
Corporate America, dancing offbeat to the rhythm
You really think this country, never sponsored terrorism?
Human rights violations, we continue the saga
El Salvador and the Contras in Nicaragua
And on top of that, you still wanna take me to prison
Just 'cause I won't trade humanity for patriotism

It's like MK-ULTRA, controlling your brain
Suggestive thinking, causing your perspective to change
They wanna rearrange the whole point of view of the ghetto
The fourth branch of the government, want us to settle
A bandana full of glittering, generality
Fighting for freedom and fighting terror, but what's reality?

Read about the history of the place that we live in
And stop letting corporate news tell lies to your children
Flow like the blood of Abraham through the Jews and the Arabs
Broken apart like a woman's heart, abused in a marriage
The brink of holy war, bottled up, like a miscarriage
Embedded correspondents don't tell the source of the tension
And they refuse to even mention, European intervention
Or the massacres in Jenin, the innocent screams
US manufactured missiles, and M-16's
Weapon contracts and corrupted American dreams
Media censorship, blacken out the video screens
A continent of oil kingdoms, bought for a bargain
Democracy is just a word, when the people are starving
The average citizen, made to be, blind to the reason
A desert full of genocide, where the bodies are freezing
And the world doesn't believe that you fighting for freedom
Cause you fucked the Middle East and gave birth to a demon
It's open season with the CIA, bugging my crib
Trapped in a ghetto region like a Palestinian kid
Where nobody gives a fuck whether you die or you live
I'm trying to give the truth, and I know the price is my life
But when I'm gone they'll sing a song about Immortal Technique
Who beheaded the President, and the princes and sheiks
You don't give a fuck about us, I can see through your facade
Like a fallen angel standing in the presence of God
Bitch niggas scared of the truth, when it looks at you hard

It's like MK-ULTRA, controlling your brain
Suggestive thinking, causing your perspective to change
They wanna rearrange the whole point of view in the ghetto
The fourth branch of the government, want us to settle

Fighting for freedom and fighting terror, but what's reality?

Martial law is coming soon to the hood, to kill you
While you hanging your flag out your project window

Yeah, the fourth branch of the government, aka the media, seems to now have a retirement plan
For ex-military officials as if their opinion was at all unbiased.
A machine shouldn't speak for men so shut the fuck up you mindless drone
And you know it's serious when these same media outfits are spending millions of dollars
On a PR campaign to try and convince you they're fair and balanced
When they're some of the most ignorant and racist people
Giving that type of mentality a safe haven
We act like we share in the spoils of war that they do
We die in wars, we don't get contracts to make money off 'em afterwards
We don't get weapons contracts, nigga
We don't get cheap labor for our companies, nigga
We are cheap labor, nigga
Turn off the news and read, nigga

Deeply twined inside of her mind
A tried and confined egret
That pines to fly south
To this mouth of mine

Pity

Too long have these emotions
Like potions, made me
A sole castellan
Trusted to keep
The weight of oceans
From her rusted gates of sleep

A dreaming angel
Lying curled in the circles of Hell
I must protect her
Watch her back for any cracks to occur
For in the witching hour
She slips into the underworld
A pearled Persephone
Deflowered by the powers
Hat around her
Down her
Whirl

Doomed to damn the rift
Across the shifting abyss
With her body and it's gift
My filthy little secret

I serve her slender hope
To preserve mankind from old ghosts
Disturbed though by recurring crimes
I sense that dead
Might be best for both

Pity

Too long have these emotions
Like potions, made me
A sole castellan
Posted to keep
Slow wheels in motion
From the human race to beat

Without her there
My nymphetamine with the faraway stare
Thin walls would crumble
Horrors would corroborate from dogstar lairs
For in the dead of the night
She spasms with orgasmic flare
This reamed Demeter
With Poseidons there inside her
Too appeased to grieve our air

Doomed to dam the rift
Across the shifting abyss
With her body and it's gift
My filthy little secret

Forever sworn to keep it
My filthy little secret
She makes me borne

Pity
Too long this urchin princess
Has incensed, made me
A wanton felon
Searching for the key
To lose her harness
And set desires lurching free

Without her there
My nymphetamine with the faraway stare
Thin walls would crumble
Horrors would corroborate from dogstar lair
But in her room at night
I care not for the underworld
Slathering and gathering emboldened Reichs
To breach, to teach
A dread thereafter

I would risk all this
For one minute of bliss
With her body and it's gift
My filthy little secret

Forever sworn to keep it
My filthy little secret

I know a deeper beauty shines
Beyond the veil
Her roots and creepers mine
As the worms beneath arise"

1760,ML1761,Slayer,Live Undead,angry,"Cascaded darkness
Walls close in on me
Nailed shut but my eyes still see
Severe anguish as my body evolves
The pain of life after death it resolves

Emptiness in twilight's rebirth
The faint sounds of shoveled earth
Madness growing as your mind dissolves
Merely secret in my dreams

Night grows cold, twilight's near
On the edge of madness the wounds are sheared
Forms of hanging, flesh shredded carcass
No spared breath
Imprisoned in a shell, ready to explode
Dead soul
Stone cold
Out into the night

Voices inside my head
Hold me under
Voices oppress
Like roaring thunder
An echo bouncing inside my brain
How much can I take of the pain
The pain!

A war raging deep inside my head
A split decision that will end with me dead

You see the agony in my eyes
Protruding aimless
I think it's time to die

A cannibal's desire feeds the fire
That burns in your head

Intense pain eats away at your brain
Thorazine coarsing through your veins

Death walks inside you
Smell death around you
Hell's evil spell takes a soul
Hear the sound of the bell
Counting off deaths toll

Laughing as you eternally rot
Searching for human flesh
And life's blood

Live Undead"

Lose another chance to break away
From all I cannot bear.
I suffer through the shame
Wishing hope would just abandon me
Till this is over.

My loveless life
I'm lost in you tonight
Waiting for you to turn around
Only to tear the whole world down.

Time and time again
Take it all and take the fall for you.
Fear is all I hold
Bound and beaten down
All the pain I can't escape today
Is always with me

My loveless life
I'm lost in you tonight
Waiting for you to turn around
Only to tear the whole world down.
My darkest night
Your arms that hold me tight
Waiting for you to turn around
Only to tear the whole world down.

All my love is lost
All my hope is gone
All my love is lost
All my hope is gone

Making it insane
Once again, I would try
To enchain you
But you open your eyes to the sky
And whisper

That you are so lonely
You are so alone
You're so alone
You're so lonely, so lonely

So I'm colouring my face
While I am here with you
Imagining the landscape of your sorrow
Is it yellow or blue?

Colouring the sky, and the threes
And the clouds, and the moonlight
I'd coloured your heart
If you didn't I did

And I wish you could just find home."

From a president derailed
I hate the shit economy

I'm expected to pretend

But I can't relate
To your verbal idiocy
No one's in control
When the government's the enemy

So light the fuse
Impose your views

Is anarchy

Actions of hostility
Breeds conformity
Annihilation will begin
Extermination from within

So light the fuse
Impose your views
Consfearacy
Insanity

I need to redefine
How I see the world today
Seems that all the war
Didn't even up the score
It's only mind pollution
There is no resolution
Still I know that in the end
I'm expected to pretend
That I can't think for myself
Blame it all on someone else
Half hearted smile

Let me tell you something; this is the 1990's. Alright?

What are you talking about, variety? Hostages?
You want to fuck some other women, now?

Why'd you pick me up?
Why'd you take me out of my fucking house and kill my parents with me?
Ain't you committed to me?
Where are we fucking going?

Just relax, alright?
It's me, your lover
Not some demon, not your father
Alright, relax

No, you're not my fucking lover
You're not my fucking

Satisfy the scorn
Rise ghosts of war

Target, assassinate
Time of your life has expired
Hatred victimize, 
Gaze in their eyes as they die
Violence inflicting of pain
Savage morticians deny
Drive the salt in the wound
Arouse the subconscious to lie

Spoken : Let me tell you why I love him

'Cause he is the truth
Said he is so real
And I love the way that he makes me feel
And if I am a reflection of him then I must be fly because
His light it shines so bright I wouldn't lie


I remember the very first day that I saw him
I found myself immediately intrigued by him
It's almost like I knew this man from another life
Like back then maybe I was his husband maybe he was my wife
And even, things I don't like about him are fine with me
'Cause it's not hard for me to understand him 'cause he's so much like me
And it's truly my pleasure to share his company
And I know that it's God's gift to breathe
The air he breathes

'Cause he is the truth
Said he is so real
And I love the way that he makes me feel
And if I am a reflection if him then I must be fly because
His light it shines so bright I wouldn't lie (no)


How can the same man that makes me so mad
Do you know what he did-(Spoken)
Turn right around and kiss me so soft
Girl do you know what he did-(Spoken)
If he ever left me I wouldn't even be sad no
Cause there's a blessin' in every lesson
And I'm glad that I knew him at all

Chrous:
'Cause he is the truth
Said he is so real
And I love the way that he makes me feel
And if I am a reflection of him then I must be fly because
His light it shines so bright


Bridge, Break-down, & Ending:
I love the way he speaks
I love the way he thinks
I love the way that he treats his mama
I love that gap in between his teeth
I love him in every way that a woman can love a man
From personal to universal but most of all
It's unconditional

You know what I'm talking about-(Spoken)
That's the way I feel
And I always will-(Spoken)

There ain't no substitute for the truth
Either it is or isn't
('Cause he is the truth)
You see the truth it needs no proof
Either it is or it isn't
('Cause he is the truth)
Now you know the truth by the way it feels
And if I am a reflection of him then I must be fly
Because he is, yes he is
I wonder does he know -Echoes"

It turned to be... L-O-V-E... and I was you man... so
I was my, lady-friend, we spent time
I found a way to be by your side...
Through the ins and outs, the wrong and rights
After a while... of bein settled down I didn't know how
To keep the love, 'cause I was young
I wish I knew then what I know now
I woudn't've let you go I swear I would've made this love grow
I spent a lot of time and a lot of dough
Tryin' to match what we had and now I...

I was hopin' we could find a way
To have what we had again today
Though it's been some time since you and I...
It wouldn't hurt to try
To find our love

Wish that I, would have known the treasures I'd found
I didn't know, until you left, I loved your smile...
Just the other day, your girl said you can't stand me...
I know you don't mean that can't we
Just slow down a minute and talk it out
I've been, in my share, of love since then
Don't know about, what you've been through
But nothin' compares... to
What we had
All I know is I need you back
And I know that you need me back
Baby let's try again to find our love oh

And I can't for-get... the times we shared
Didn't know love until love was gone

The smell of cold, car seat is freezing
The world is sleeping, I am numb

Up the stairs to her apartment
She is balled up on the couch
Her mom and dad went down to Charlotte
They're not home to find us out

And we drive
Now that I have found someone
I'm feeling more alone
Than I ever have before

She's a brick and I'm drownin' slowly
Off the coast and I'm headed nowhere
She's a brick and I'm drownin' slowly

They call her name at seven-thirty
I pace around the parking lot
And I walk down to buy her flowers
And sell some gifts that I got

Can't you see
It's not me you're dying for
Now she's feeling more alone
Than she ever has before

She's a brick and I'm drownin' slowly
Off the coast and I'm headed nowhere
She's a brick and I'm drownin' slowly

As weeks went by, it showed that she was not fine
They told me, ""Son, it's time to tell the truth.""
And she broke down and I broke down
'Cause I was tired of lying

Driving back to her apartment
For the moment, we're alone
Yeah, she's alone and I'm alone
Now I know it

He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting

He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's chokin' how, everybody's jokin' now
The clocks runs out, time's up, over, blow

Snap back to reality, oh, there goes gravity, oh
There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't
Give up that easy no, he won't have it he knows

He goes home, and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose, 'cause here goes the cold water

Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine to five

And I can't provide the right type of
Life for my family, 'cause man these goddamn
Food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life

And these times are so hard, and it's getting even harder

Caught up between bein' a father and a Prima Donna
Baby mama drama screamin' on and too much for me to wanna

Stay in one spot, another day of monotony
Has gotten me to the point I'm like a snail I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not
